<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Our</span> apology for preparing a bee book is a very simple one.
We are so frequently applied to for advice on matters connected
with bees and bee-hives, that it seemed likely to prove a
great advantage, alike to our correspondents and ourselves, if we
could point to a "handy-book" of our own, which should contain
full and detailed replies sufficient to meet all ordinary enquiries.
Most of the apiarian manuals possess some special excellence or
other, and we have no wish to disparage any of them. Yet in all,
we have found a want of explanations relating to several of the more
recent improvements.</p>

<p>It has, more especially, been our aim to give explicit and detailed
directions on most subjects connected with the hiving and removing
of bees; and also, to show how, by judicious application of the
"depriving" system, the productive powers of the bees may be
enormously increased.</p>

<p>We need say little here as to the interest that attaches to the
apiary as a source of perennial pleasure for the amateur naturalist.
Many of the hives and methods of management are described
with a direct reference to this class of bee-keepers; so that,
besides plain and simple directions suitable for cottagers with
their ordinary hives, this work will be found to include instructions
useful for the scientific apiarian, or, at least, valuable, for those who
desire to gain a much wider acquaintance with the secrets of bee-keeping
than is now usually possessed. We would lay stress on
the term "acquaintance," for there is nothing in the management
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">- viii -</span>
of the various bar-and-frame hives which is at all difficult when
frequent practice has rendered the bee-keeper familiar with them.
Such explicit directions are herein given as to how the right
operations may be performed at the right times, that a novice may
at once commence to use the modern hives. The word "new-fangled"
has done good service for the indolent and prejudiced;
but we trust that our readers will be of a very different class. Let
them give a fair trial to the modern appliances for the humane and
depriving system of bee-keeping, and they will find offered to them
an entirely new field of interest and observation. At present, our
continental neighbours far surpass us as bee-masters; but we trust
that the season of 1865, if the summer be fine, will prove a turning
point in the course of. English bee-keeping. There is little doubt
that a greater number of intelligent and influential persons in this
country will become bee-keepers than has ever been the case before.</p>

<p>Our task would have lost half its interest, did we not hope that
it would result in something beyond the encouragement of a refined
and interesting amusement for the leisurely classes. The social importance
of bee keeping as a source of pecuniary profit for small farmers
and agricultural labourers, has never been appreciated as it deserves.
Yet these persons will not, of themselves, lay aside the bungling and
wasteful plan of destroying the bees, or learn without being taught
the only proper method, that of deprivation. Their educated neighbours
when once interested in bee-keeping, will be the persons to introduce
the more profitable system of humane bee-keeping. The clergy,
especially, as permanent residents in the country, may have great
influence in this respect. There is not a rural or suburban parish
in the kingdom in which bee-keeping might not be largely extended,
and the well being of all but the very poorest inhabitants would
be greatly promoted. Not only would the general practice of bee-keeping
add largely to the national resources, but that addition
would chiefly fall to the share of those classes to whom it would be
of most value. Moreover, in the course of thus adding to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">- ix -</span>
income, the uneducated classes would become interested in an
elevating and instructive pursuit.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe that honey, whether regarded as a
manufactured article or as an agricultural product, is obtained
under economical conditions of exceptional advantage. If regarded
as a manufactured article, we notice that there is no outlay required
for "labour," nor any expense for "raw material." The industrious
labourers are eager to utilize all their strength: they never
"combine" except for the benefit of their master, they never
"strike" for wages, and they provide their own subsistence. All
that the master manufacturer of honey has to do financially, is to
make a little outlay for "fixed capital" in the needful "plant" of
hives and utensils&mdash;no "floating capital" is needed. Then, on the
other hand, if we regard honey as an agricultural product, it
presents as such a still more striking contrast to the economists'
theory of what are the "requisites of production." Not only is
there no outlay needed for wages and none for raw material, but
there is nothing to be paid for "use of a natural agent." Every
square yard of land in the United Kingdom may come to be
cultivated, as in China, but no proprietor will ever be able to claim
"rent" for those "waste products" of the flowers and leaves, which
none but the winged workers of the hive can ever utilize.</p>

<p>The recent domestication in England of the Ligurian or
"Italian Alp" bee adds a new and additional source of interest
to bee-culture. We have, therefore, gone pretty fully into this
part of the subject; and believe that what is here published with
regard to their introduction embodies the most recent and reliable
information respecting them that is possessed by English apiarians.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Some of our apiarian friends may be inclined to be discouraged from
cultivating the Ligurian bees in consequence of the liability to their becoming
hybridised when located in proximity to the black bees. We can dispel these
fears by stating that we have not unfrequently found that hybrid queens
possess the surprising fecundity of the genuine Italian ones, whilst the English
stocks in course of time become strengthened by the infusion of foreign blood.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">- x -</span></p>

<p>We are under many obligations for the advice and assistance
that we have on many occasions received from Mr. T. W.
Woodbury, of Exeter, whose apiarian skill is unrivalled in this
country. Our acknowledgments are also due to Mr. Henry Taylor,
author of an excellent "Bee-Keeper's Manual," for his help
and counsel during the earlier years of our apiarian experience.
Both the before-mentioned gentlemen have freely communicated to
us their contrivances and suggestions, without thought of fee or
reward for them. In common with most recent writers on bee-culture,
we are necessarily largely indebted to the standard works of
Huber and succeeding apiarians. From the more recent volume of
the Rev. L. L. Langstroth we have also obtained useful information.
But having ourselves of later years had considerable experience in
the manipulation and practical management of bees, we are enabled
to confirm or qualify the statement of others, as well as to summarize
information gleaned from many various sources. We should state
that our thanks are due to Mr. W. Martin Wood, who has rendered
us valuable aid in the arrangement of this work.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that we have no <i>patented devices</i>
to push: we are free to choose out of the many apiarian
contrivances that have been offered of late years, and we
feel perfectly at liberty to praise or blame as our experience
warrants us in doing. It does not follow that we necessarily
disparage hives which are not described herein; we have
sought, as much as possible, to indicate the <i>principles</i> on which
<i>good hives</i> must be constructed, whatever their outward size or
shape. All through the work, we have endeavoured to adopt the
golden rule of "submission to nature," by reference to which all the
fancied difficulties of bee-keeping may be easily overcome. In none
of the attempts of men to hold sway over natural objects, is the truth
of Bacon's leading doctrine more beautifully illustrated than in the
power that the apiarian exercises in the little world of bees.</p>

<p>There are one or two literary peculiarities of this work to which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">- xi -</span>
we ought to refer. It will be noticed that the numbers affixed to
the names of the various hives and utensils do not follow in regular
order. Those numbers refer to our Illustrated Catalogue, with
which most English apiarians have long been familiar, and we
could not alter them without great inconvenience.</p>

<p>Some persons may consider we have used too many poetical
quotations in a book dealing wholly with matters of fact. We
trust, however, that an examination of the extracts will at once
remove that feeling of objection.</p>

<p>We venture to hope that the following pages contain many
valuable hints and interesting statements which may tend to excite
increased and renewed attention to the most useful and industrious
of all insects. Although bees have neither reason nor religion for
their guide, yet from them man may learn many a lesson of virtue
and industry, and may even draw from them thoughts suggestive
of trust and faith in God.</p>

<p>We beg leave to conclude our preface, and introduce the subject,
by the following extract from Shakespeare,&mdash;who, without doubt,
kept bees in that garden at Stratford wherein he used to meditate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">There</span> are two classes of persons for whom bee-culture should have
a strong interest, and two distinct purposes for which the pursuit
may be followed. First, there is the cottager or small farmer who,
in thousands of instances, might add considerably to his income by
bee-keeping; and secondly, there is the man of "retired leisure"
and refinement, who, in the personal tendance of an apiary would find
an easy and interesting occupation, and one which could not fail to
quicken his faculties of general scientific observation. Moreover, in
contemplating the wonderful skill, industry, and prevision of his
insect artisans, the bee-keeper would find in his apiary constant
illustrations of creative wisdom.</p>

<p>Amongst the humbler classes in the rural districts, the neglect
of bee-keeping is to be attributed to an exaggerated idea of the
trouble needful for the care of a few hives, and also to ignorance of
the easier and more profitable methods of modern management. Many
of the wealthier country or suburban residents, also, are averse to
the personal trouble which they fancy needful in keeping an apiary;
and, perhaps, some gentlemen are more afraid than they would like
to own of that very efficient weapon of defence with which the
honey bee is provided. But the prejudices against bees are quite
unnecessary; bees are as tractable as they are intelligent, and it is
the purpose of this little book to show that bee-culture is an easy
and safe, as well as a deeply interesting, pursuit. Possibly, also,
some who do us the favour to read our detailed explanations, will
see how the rural clergyman, or the benevolent landlord, who keeps
an apiary of his own, may be of signal service to his poorer neighbours
in explaining to them the mysteries of bee-keeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">- 2 -</span></p>


<p id="inhabitants" class="caption3">I. THE INHABITANTS OF THE HIVE.</p>

<p>Every hive or bee colony comprises three distinct classes of
bees, each class having functions peculiar to itself, and which are
essential to the well-being of the whole community. As each bee
knows its own proper duties, they all work harmoniously and zealously
together, for the common weal. Certain apparent exceptions to the
good-fellowship of the bees will be hereafter noticed, but those
arise out of essential conditions in the social economy of the bee
community.</p>

<p>The three classes of bees are:&mdash;the queen bee, with the pup&aelig; or
embryos intended for queens; the working bees; and the drones or
male bees.</p>

<p id="queen"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span>&mdash;Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> introduces the queen bee to our
notice thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">First of the throng, and foremost of the whole,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One 'stands confest the sovereign and the soul.'</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Dr. Evans,&mdash;who may be styled the poet-laureate of the bees,&mdash;lived at
Shrewsbury, where he practiced as a physician. His poem on bees is written
with great taste and careful elaboration, and it describes the habits of bees
with a degree of accuracy only attainable after continuous scientific observation.</p>

</div>

<p>The queen may very readily be distinguished from the rest of the
bees by the greater length of her body, and the comparative shortness
of her wings; her legs are longer, and are not furnished with either
brushes or baskets as those of the working bee, for being constantly
fed by the latter, she does not need those implements; the upper
surface of her body is of a brighter black than the other bees,
whilst her colour underneath is a yellowish brown; her wings, which
do not extend more than half the length of her body, are sinewy and
strong; her long abdomen tapers nearly to a point; her head is
rounder, her tongue more slender, and not nearly so long, as that of
the working bee, and her sting is curved; her movements are
measured and majestic, as she moves in the hive the other bees form
a circle round her, none venturing to turn their backs upon her,
but all anxious to show that respect and attention due to her rank
and station. Whenever in the exercise of her sovereign will the
queen wishes to travel amongst her subjects, she experiences no
inconvenience from overcrowding; although the part of the hive to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">- 3 -</span>
which she is journeying may be the most populous, way is immediately
made, the common bees tumbling over each other to get out of her
way, so great is their anxiety not to interfere with the royal progress.</p>

<p>It is the chief function of the queen to lay the eggs from which
all future bees originate, the multiplication of the species being the
purpose of her existence, and she follows it up with an assiduity
similar to that with which the workers construct combs or collect
honey. A queen is estimated to lay in the breeding season from
1,500 to 2,000 eggs a-day, and in the course of one year is
supposed to produce more than 100,000 bees. This is indeed a vast
number; but when there is taken into consideration the great
number required for swarms, the constant lessening of their strength
by death in various ways, and the many casualties attending them
in their distant travels in search of the luscious store, it does not
seem that the case is over stated.</p>

<p>In a Glass Unicomb Hive,&mdash;which we shall hereinafter describe,&mdash;all
the movements of the queen-bee may be traced; she may be
seen thrusting her head into a cell to discover whether it be occupied
with an egg or honey, and if empty, she turns round in a dignified
manner and inserts her long body&mdash;so long, that she is able to
deposit the egg at the bottom of the cell; she then passes on to
another, and so continues industriously multiplying her laborious
subjects. It not unfrequently happens when the queen is prolific,
and if it be an early season, that many eggs are wasted for want of
unoccupied cells; for in that case the queen leaves them exposed at
the bottom of the hive when they are greedily devoured by the bees.
The queen-bee, unlike the great majority of her subjects, is a stayer
at home; generally speaking, she only quits the hive twice in her life.
The first occasion is on the all-important day of her marriage, which
always takes place at a great height in the air, and generally on
the second or third day of her princess-life; she never afterwards
leaves the hive, except to lead off an emigrating swarm. Evans,
with proper loyalty, has duly furnished a glowing epithalamium for
the queen-bee:&mdash;thus.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When noon-tide Sirius glares on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Young love ascends the glowing sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From vein to vein swift shoots prolific fire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thrills each insect fibre with desire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Nature to fulfil thy prime decree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wheels round in wanton rings, the courtier Bee;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now shyly distant, now with bolder air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He woos and wins the all-complying fair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through fields of ether, veiled in vap'ry gloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They seek, with amorous haste, the nuptial room;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As erst the immortal pair, on Ida's height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wreath'd round their noon of joy, ambrosial night,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The loyalty and attachment of bees to their queen is one of
their most remarkable characteristics; they constantly supply her
with food, and fawn upon and caress her, softly touching her with
their antenn&aelig;, a favour which she occasionally returns. When she
moves about the hive, all the bees through whom she successively
passes pay her the same homage; those whom she leaves behind in
her track close together, and resume their accustomed occupations.</p>

<p>The majestic deportment of the queen-bee and the homage paid
to her is, with a little poetic license, thus described by Evans:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But mark of royal port and awful mien.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where moves with measured pace the insect Queen!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Twelve chosen guards, with slow and solemn gait.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bend at her nod, and round her person wait.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">This homage is, however, only paid to matron queens. Whilst they
continue princesses, they receive no distinctive marks of respect.
Dr. Dunbar, the noted Scotch apiarian, observed a very striking
instance of this whilst experimenting on the combative qualities of
the queen-bee. "So long," says he, "as the queen which survived
the rencontre with her rival, remained a virgin, not the slightest
degree of respect or attention was paid her&mdash;not a single bee gave
her food; she was obliged, as often as she required it, to help herself;
and in crossing the honey cells for that purpose, she had to
scramble, often with difficulty, over the crowd, not an individual of
which got out of her way, or seemed to care whether she fed or
starved; but no sooner did she become a mother, than the scene
was changed, and all testified towards her that most affectionate
attention, which is uniformly exhibited to fertile queens."</p>

<p>The queen-bee, though provided with a sting, never uses it on
any account, except in combat with her sister queens. But she admits
of no rival to her throne; almost her first act on coming forth from
the cell, is an attempt to tear open and destroy the cells containing
the pup&aelig; of princesses likely to become competitors. Should it so
happen that another queen of similar age does exist in the hive at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span>
the same time, the two are speedily brought into contact with each
other in order to fight it out and decide by a struggle, mortal to one
of them, which is to be the ruler;&mdash;the stronger of course is
victorious, and remains supreme. This, it must be admitted, is a
wiser method of settling the affair than it would be to range the
whole band under two distinct banners, and so create a civil war,
killing and destroying each other for matters with which they individually
have little or no concern: for the bees care not which
queen it is, as long as they are certain of having one to rule over
them and perpetuate the community.</p>

<p>After perusing the description given above of the attachment
of bees to their queen, it may be easy to imagine the consternation
a hive is thrown into when deprived of her presence. The bees first
make a diligent search for their monarch in the hive, and then afterwards
rush forth in immense numbers to seek her. When such a
commotion is observed in an apiary, the experienced bee-master will
repair the loss by giving a queen: the bees have generally their
own remedy for such a calamity, in their power of raising a new
queen from amongst their larv&aelig;; but if neither of these means be
available, the whole colony dwindles and dies. The following is the
method by which working bees provide a successor to the throne
when deprived of their queen by accident, or in anticipation of the
first swarm, which is always led by the old queen:&mdash;</p>

<p>They select, when not more than three days old, an egg or grub
previously intended for a worker-bee, and then enlarge the cell so
selected by destroying the surrounding partitions; they thus form
a royal cradle, in shape very much like an acorn cup inverted. The
chosen embryo is then fed liberally with a peculiar description of
nurture, called by naturalists "royal jelly"&mdash;a pungent food, prepared
by the working bees exclusively for those of the larv&aelig; that are
destined to become candidates for the honour of royalty. Should
a queen be forcibly separated from her subjects, she resents the
interference, refuses food, pines, and dies.</p>

<p>The whole natural history of the queen-bee is in itself a subject
that will well repay for continuous study. Those who desire to
follow it, we would refer to the complete works of <span class="smcap">Huber</span>&mdash;the
greatest of apiarians,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swammerdam</span>, <span class="smcap">Bevan</span>, <span class="smcap">Langstroth</span>, &amp;c.
The observations upon the queen-bee needful to verify the above mentioned
facts can only be made in hives constructed for the purpose,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span>
of which our "Unicomb Observatory Hive" is one of the best. In
ordinary hives the queen is scarcely ever to be seen; where there
are several rows of comb, she invariably keeps between them, both
for warmth and to be more secure from danger. The writer has
frequently observed in stocks which have unfortunately died, that the
queen was one of the last to expire; and she is always more difficult
to gain possession of than other bees, being by instinct taught that
she is indispensable to the welfare of her subjects.</p>

<p>The queen enjoys a far longer life than any of her subjects, her
age generally extending to four or even five years. The drones,
which are mostly hatched in the early spring, seldom live more than
three or four months, even if they should escape the sting of the
executioner, to which they generally fall victims. The worker-bee,
it is now a well-ascertained fact, lives from six to eight months, in
no case exceeding the latter; so that we may reckon that the bees
hatched in April and May expire about the end of the year, and it is
those of the autumn who carry on the duties of the hive until the
spring and summer, that being the time when the greatest number
of eggs are laid. The population of a hive is very small during the
winter, in comparison with the vast numbers gathering produce in
the summer,&mdash;produce which they themselves live to enjoy but for
a short period. So that not only, as of old, may lessons of industry
be learned from bees, but they also teach self-denial to mankind,
since they labour for the community rather than for themselves.
Evans, in describing the age of bees, thus paraphrases the well
known couplet of Homer in allusion to the fleeting generations
of men:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But Dr. Evans had been "told" what was not correct when he
sought to dignify drones with the office of "nursing fathers,"&mdash;that
task is undertaken by the younger of the working-bees. No occupation
falls to the lot of the drones in gathering honey, nor have they the
means provided them by nature for assisting in the labours of the hive.
The drones are the progenitors of working bees, and nothing more;
so far as is known, that is the only purpose of their short existence.</p>

<p>In a well-populated hive the number of drones is computed
at from one to two thousand. "Naturalists," says Huber, "have
been extremely embarrassed to account for the number of males in
most hives, and which seem only a burden to the community, since
they appear to fulfil no function. But we now begin to discern
the object of nature in multiplying them to such an extent. As
fecundation cannot be accomplished within the hive, and as the
queen is obliged to traverse the expanse of the atmosphere, it is
requisite that the males should be numerous, that she may have the
chance of meeting some one of them in her flight. Were only two
or three in each hive, there would be little probability of their
departure at the same instant with the queen, or that they would
meet her in their excursions; and most of the females might thus
remain sterile." It is important for the safety of the queen-bee that
her stay in the air should be as brief as possible: her large size,
and the slowness of her flight, render her an easy prey to birds. It
is not now thought that the queen always pairs with a drone of the same
hive, as Huber seems to have supposed. Once impregnated,&mdash;as is
the case with most insects,&mdash;the queen-bee continues productive
during the remainder of her existence. It has, however, been
found that though old queens cease to lay worker eggs, they may
continue to lay those of drones. The swarming season being over,
that is about the end of July, a general massacre of the "lazy fathers"
takes place. Dr. Bevan, in the "Honey Bee," observes on this
point, "the work of the drones being now completed, they are
regarded as useless consumers of the fruits of others' labour, love
is at once converted into hate, and a general proscription takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span>
place. The unfortunate victims evidently perceive their danger, for
they are never, at this time, seen resting in one place, but darting
in and out of the hive with the utmost precipitation, as if in fear
of being seized."</p>

<p>Their destruction is thought, by some, to be caused by their
being harassed until they quit the hive; but Huber says he
ascertained that the death of the drones was caused by the stings
of the workers. Supposing the drones come forth in May, which
is the average period of their being hatched, their destruction takes
place somewhere about the commencement of August, so that three
months is the usual extent of their existence; but should it so
happen that the usual development of the queen has been retarded,
or that the hive has in any case been deprived of her, the massacre
of the drones is deferred. But in any case, the natural term of
the life of drone bees does not exceed four months, so that they are
all dead before the winter, and are not allowed to be useless consumers
of the general store.</p>

<p id="worker"><span class="smcap">The Worker Bee.</span>&mdash;The working bees form, by far, the most
numerous class of the three kinds contained in the hive, and least
of all require description. They are the smallest of the bees, are
dark brown in colour or nearly black, and much more active on the
wing than are either drones or queens. The usual number in a
healthy hive varies from twelve to thirty thousand; and, previous
to swarming, exceeds the larger number. The worker-bee is of the
same sex as the queen, but is only partially developed. Any egg of
a worker-bee,&mdash;by the cell being enlarged, as already described, and
the "royal jelly" being supplied to the larva,&mdash;may be hatched
into a mature and perfect queen. This, one of the most curious
facts connected with the natural history of bees, may be verified
in any apiary by most interesting experiments, which may be turned
to important use. With regard to the supposed distinctions between
"nursing" and working bees, it is now agreed that it only consists
in a division of labour,&mdash;the young workers staying at home to feed
the larv&aelig; until they are themselves vigorous enough to range the
fields in quest of supplies. But, for many details of unfailing
interest, we must again refer our readers to the standard works on
bees that have already been named.</p>

<p id="eggs"><span class="smcap">The Eggs of Bees.</span>&mdash;It is necessary that some explanation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
should be given as to the existence of the bee before it emerges
from the cell.</p>

<p>The eggs of all the three kinds of bees when first deposited are
of an oval shape, and of a bluish-white colour. In four or five
days the egg changes to a worm, and in this stage is known by
the names of larva or grub, in which state it remains four to six days
more; during this period it is fed by the nurse-bees with a mixture
of farina and honey, a constant supply of which is given to it: the
next transformation is to the nymph or pupa form; the nurse-bees
now seal up the cell with a preparation similar to wax; and
then the pupa spins round itself a film or cocoon, just as a
silkworm does in its chrysalis state. The microscope shows that
this cradle-curtain is perforated with very minute holes, through
which the baby-bee is duly supplied with air. No further attention
on the part of the bees is now requisite except a proper degree
of heat, which they take care to keep up, a position for the breeding
cells being selected in the centre of the hive where the temperature
is likely to be most congenial.</p>

<p>Twenty-one days after the egg is first laid (unless cold weather
should have retarded it) the bee quits the pupa state, and nibbling its
way through the waxen covering that has enclosed it, comes forth
a winged insect. In the Unicomb Observatory Hive, the young
bees may distinctly be seen as they literally fight their way into the
world, for the other bees do not take the slightest notice, nor afford
them any assistance. We have frequently been amused in watching
the eager little new-comer, now obtruding its head, and anon compelled
to withdraw into the cell, to escape being trampled on by
the apparently unfeeling throng, until at last it has succeeded in
making its exit. The little grey creature, after brushing and
shaking itself, enters upon its duties in the hive, and in a day or
two may be seen gathering honey in the fields&mdash;some say on the day
of its birth,&mdash;thus early illustrating that character for industry,
which has been proverbial, at least, since the days of Aristotle, and
which has in our day been rendered familiar even to infant minds
through the nursery rhymes of Dr. Watts.</p>

<p id="increase"><span class="smcap">Increase of Bees.</span>&mdash;Every one is familiar with the natural
process of "swarming," by which bees provide themselves with fresh
space and seek to plant colonies to absorb their increase of population.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
But the object of the bee-master is to train and educate
his bees, and in so doing he avoids much of the risk and trouble
which is incurred by allowing the busy folk to follow their own
devices. The various methods for this end adopted by apiarians all
come under the term of the "depriving" system; and they form part
of the great object of humane and economical bee-keeping, which is
to save the bees alive instead of slaughtering them as under the old
clumsy system. A very natural question is often asked,&mdash;how it is
that upon the depriving system, where our object is to prevent
swarming, the increase of numbers is not so great as upon the
old plan? It will be seen that the laying of eggs is performed by
the queen only, and that there is but one queen to each hive; so
that where swarming is prevented, there remains only one hive or
stock, as the superfluous princesses are not allowed to come to
maturity. Our plan of giving additional store-room will, generally
speaking, prevent swarming; this stay-at-home policy, we contend,
is an advantage, for instead of the loss of time consequent upon a
swarm hanging out preparatory to flight, all the bees are engaged
in collecting honey, and that at a time when the weather is most
favourable and the food most abundant. Upon the old system, the
swarm leaves the hive simply because the dwelling has not been
enlarged at the time when the bees are increasing. The emigrants
are always led off by the old queen, leaving either young or embryo
queens to lead off after swarms, and to furnish a mistress for the old
stock, and carry on the multiplication of the species. Upon the
antiquated and inhuman plan where so great a destruction takes
place by the brimstone match, breeding must, of course, be allowed
to go on to its full extent to make up for such sacrifices. Our
chief object under the new system is to obtain honey free from all
extraneous matter. Pure honey cannot be gathered from combs
where storing and breeding are performed in the same compartment.
For fuller explanations on this point, we refer to the various descriptions
of our improved hives in a subsequent section of this work.</p>

<p>There can now be scarcely two opinions as to the uselessness of
the rustic plan of immolating the poor bees after they have striven
through the summer so to "improve each shining hour." The
ancients in Greece and Italy took the surplus honey and spared the
bees, and now for every intelligent bee-keeper there are ample
appliances wherewith to attain the same results. Mr. Langstroth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
quotes from the German the following epitaph which, he says,
"might be properly placed over every pit of brimstoned bees:"&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be our pleasing task in subsequent chapters to show "a
more excellent way."</p>


<p id="swarming" class="caption3">SWARMING.</p>

<p>The spring is the best period at which to open an apiary, and
swarming-time is a good starting point for the new bee-keeper. The
period known as the swarming season is during the months of May
and June. With a very forward stock, and in exceedingly fine
weather, bees do occasionally swarm in April. The earlier the
swarm the greater is its value. If bees swarm in July, they seldom
gather sufficient to sustain themselves through the winter; though,
by careful feeding, they may easily be kept alive, if hived early in
the month.</p>

<p>The cause of a swarm leaving the stock-hive is, that the population
has grown too large for it. Swarming is a provision of
nature for remedying the inconvenience of overcrowding, and is the
method whereby the bees seek for space in which to increase their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span>
stores. By putting on "super hives," the required relief may, in
many cases, be given to them; but should the multiplication of
stocks be desired, the bee-keeper will defer increasing the space
until the swarm has issued forth. In May, when the spring has
been fine, the queen-bee is very active in laying eggs, and the
increase in a strong healthy hive is so prodigious that emigration is
necessary, or the bees would cease to work.</p>

<p>It is now a well established fact that the old queen goes forth
with the first swarm, preparation having been made to supply her
place as soon as the bees determine upon the necessity of a division
of their commonwealth. Thus the sovereignty of the old hive, after
the first swarm has issued, devolves upon a young queen.</p>

<p>As soon as the swarm builds combs in its new abode, the
emigrant-queen, being impregnated and her ovaries full, begins
laying eggs in the cells, and thereby speedily multiplies the
labourers of the new colony. Although there is now amongst
apiarians no doubt that the old queen quits her home, there is no
rule as to the composition of the swarm&mdash;old and young alike
depart. Some show unmistakable signs of age by their ragged
wings, others their extreme youth by their lighter colour; how they
determine which shall stay and which shall go has not yet been
ascertained. In preparation for flight, bees commence filling their
honey bags, taking sufficient, it is said, for three days' sustenance.
This store is needful, not only for food, but to enable the bees to
commence the secretion of wax and the building of combs in their
new domicile.</p>

<p>On the day of emigration the weather must be fine, warm, and
clear, with but little wind stirring; for the old queen, like a prudent
matron, will not venture out unless the day is in every way favorable.
Whilst her majesty hesitates, either for the reasons we have mentioned,
or because the internal arrangements are not sufficiently matured,
the bees will often fly about or hang in clusters at the entrance of
the hive for two or three days and nights together, all labour
meanwhile being suspended. The agitation of the little folk is
well described by Evans:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">See where, with hurried step, the impassioned throng</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pace o'er the hive, and seem, with plaintive song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">T' invite the loitering queen; now range the floor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hang in cluster'd columns from the door;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">- 13 -</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or now in restless rings around they fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor spoil thy sip, nor load the hollowed thigh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E'en the dull drone his wonted ease gives o'er,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haps his unwieldly wings, and longs to soar.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But when all is ready, a scene of the most violent agitation takes
place; the bees rush out in vast numbers, forming quite a dark cloud
as they traverse the air.</p>

<p>The time selected for the departure of the emigrants is generally
between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.; most swarms come off within an hour
of noon. It is a very general remark that bees choose a Sunday for
swarming, and probably this is because then greater stillness reigns
around. It will not be difficult to imagine that the careful bee-keeper
is anxious to keep a strict watch, lest he should lose such
a treasure when once it takes wing. The exciting scene at a
bee-swarming has been well described by the apiarian laureate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Up mounts the chief, and, to the cheated eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ten thousand shuttles dart along the sky;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As swift through &aelig;ther rise the rushing swarms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gay dancing to the beam their sunbright forms;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And each thin form, still lingering on the sight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trails as it shoots, a line of silver light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High poised on buoyant wing, the thoughtful queen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In gaze attentive, views the varied scene,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Swift as the falcon's sweep, the monarch bends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her flight abrupt; the following host descends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Round the fine twig, like clustered grapes they close</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In thickening wreaths, and court a short repose.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In many country districts it is a time-honoured custom for the
good folks of the village to commence on such occasions a terrible
noise of tanging and ringing with frying pan and key. This is done
with the absurd notion that the bees are charmed with the clangorous
din, and may by it be induced to settle as near as possible to the
source of such sweet sounds. This is, however, quite a mistake; there
are other and better means for the purpose. The practice of ringing
was originally adopted for a different and far more sensible object,
viz., for the purpose of giving notice that a swarm had issued forth,
and that the owner was anxious to claim the right of following,
even though it should alight on a neighbour's premises. It would
DC curious to trace how this ancient ceremony has thus got corrupted
from the original design.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span></p>

<p>In case the bees do not speedily after swarming manifest signs
of settling, a few handfuls of sand or loose mould may be thrown
up in the air so as to fall among the winged throng; they mistake
this for rain, and then very quickly determine upon settling. Some
persons squirt a little water from a garden engine in order to
produce the same effect.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, many ingenious devices used by apiarians
for decoying the swarms. Mr. Langstroth mentions a plan of
stringing dead bees together, and tying a bunch of them on any shrub
or low tree upon which it is desirable that they should alight;
another plan is, to hang some black woven material near the hives,
so that the swarming bees may be led to suppose they see another
colony, to which they will hasten to attach themselves. Swarms
have a great affinity for each other when they are adrift in the air;
but, of course, when the union has been effected, the rival queens have
to do battle for supremacy. A more ingenious device than any of the
above, is by means of a mirror to flash a reflection of the sun's rays
amongst a swarm, which bewilders the bees, and checks their flight.
It is manifestly often desirable to use some of these endeavours to
induce early settlement, and to prevent, if possible, the bees from
clustering in high trees or under the eaves of houses, where it may
be difficult to hive them.</p>

<p>Should prompt measures not be taken to hive the bees as soon
as the cluster is well formed, there is danger of their starting on a
second flight; and this is what the apiarian has so much to dread.
If the bees set off a second time, it is generally for a long flight, often
for miles, so that in such a case it is usually impossible to follow
them, and consequently a valuable colony may be irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>Too much care cannot be exercised to prevent the sun's rays
falling on a swarm when it has once settled. If exposed to heat
in this way, bees are very likely to decamp. We have frequently
stretched matting or sheeting on poles so as to intercept the glare,
and thus render their temporary position cool and comfortable.</p>

<p>Two swarms sometimes depart at the same time and join
together; in such a case, we recommend that they be treated as one
by putting them into a hive as before described, taking care to give
abundant room, and not to delay affording access to the super hive
or glasses. They will settle their own notions of sovereignty by one
queen destroying the other. There are means of separating two
swarms if done at the time; but the operation is a formidable one,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span>
and does not always repay even those most accustomed to such
manipulation.</p>

<p>With regard to preparations for taking a swarm, our advice to
the bee-keeper must be the reverse of Mrs. Glass's notable injunction
as to the cooking of a hare. Some time before you expect to take a
swarm, be sure to have a proper hive in which to take it, and also
every other requisite properly ready. Here we will explain what was
said in the introduction as to the safety of moving and handling
bees. A bee-veil or dress will preserve the most sensitive from the
possibility of being stung. This article, which may be bought with
the hives, is made of net close enough to exclude bees, but open
enough for the operator's vision. It is made to go over the hat of
a lady or cap of a gentleman; it can be tied round the waist, and
has sleeves fastening at the wrist. A pair of photographer's india
rubber gloves completes the full dress of the apiarian, who is then
invulnerable even to enraged bees. But bees when swarming are
in an eminently peaceful frame of mind; having dined sumptuously,
they require to be positively provoked before they will sting. Yet
there may be one or two foolish bees who, having neglected to fill their
honey bags, are inclined to vent their ill-humour on the kind apiarian.
When all is ready, the new hive is held or placed in an inverted
position under the cluster of bees, which the operator detaches from
their perch with one or two quick shakes; the floorboard is then
placed on the hive, which is then slowly turned up on to its base,
and it is well to leave it a short time in the same place, in order to
allow of stragglers joining their companions.</p>

<p>If the new swarm is intended for transportation to a distance, it
is as well for it to be left at the same spot until evening, provided
the sun is shaded from it: but if the hive is meant to stand in or
near the same garden, it is better to remove it within half an hour
to its permanent position, because so eager are newly-swarmed bees
for pushing forward the work of furnishing their empty house,
that they sally forth at once in search of materials.</p>

<p>A swarm of bees in their natural state contains from 10,000 to
20,000 insects, whilst in an established hive they number 40,000
and upwards. 5,000 bees are said to weigh one pound; a good
swarm will weigh from three to five pounds. We have known
swarms not heavier than 2&frac12; pounds, that were in very excellent
condition in August as regards store for the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span></p>

<p>Hitherto, all our remarks have had reference to first or "prime"
swarms; these are the best, and when a swarm is purchased such
should be bargained for.</p>

<p>Second swarms, known amongst cottage bee-keepers as "casts,"
usually issue from the hive nine or ten days after the first
has departed. It is not always that a second swarm issues, so much
depends on the strength of the stock, the weather, and other causes;
but should the bees determine to throw out another, the first hatched
queen in the stock-hive is prevented by her subjects from destroying
the other royal princesses, as she would do if left to her own devices.
The consequence is that, like some people who cannot have their own
way, she is highly indignant; and when thwarted in her purpose,
utters, in quick succession, shrill, angry sounds, much resembling
"<i>peep, peep</i>," commonly called "piping," but which more courtly
apiarians have styled the <i>vox regalis</i>.</p>

<p>This royal wailing continues during the evening, and is
sometimes so loud as to be distinctly audible many yards from the
hive. When this is the case, a swarm may be expected either on
the next day, or at latest within three days. The second swarm is
not quite so chary of weather as the first; it was the old lady who
exercised so much caution, disliking to leave home except in the
best of summer weather.</p>

<p>In some instances, owing to favourable breeding seasons and
prolific queens, a third swarm issues from the hive, this is termed a
"colt;" and in remarkable instances, even a fourth, which in rustic
phrase is designated a "filly." A swarm from a swarm is called a
"maiden" swarm, and according to bee theory, will again have the
old queen for its leader.</p>

<p>The bee-master should endeavour to prevent his labourers from
swarming more than once; his policy is rather to encourage the
industrious gathering of honey by keeping a good supply of "supers"
on the hives. Sometimes, however, he may err in putting on the
supers too early or unduly late, and the bees will then swarm a
second time, instead of making use of the store-rooms thus provided.
In such a case, the clever apiarian, having spread the swarm on the
ground, will select the queen, and cause the bees to go back to the
hive from whence they came. This operation requires an amount of
apiarian skill which, though it may easily be attained, is greater
than is usually possessed.</p>

<p id="Nutts_Coll_Hive" class="caption3">NUTT'S COLLATERAL HIVE. No. 1.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Nutt, author of "Humanity to Honey Bees," may
be regarded as a pioneer of modern apiarians; we therefore select his
hive wherewith to begin a description of those we have confidence
in recommending. Besides, an account of Mr. Nutt's hive will
necessarily include references to the various principles which
subsequent inventors have kept in view.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page17" style="width: 281px;">
  <img src="images/page17.png" width="281" height="297" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Nutt's Collateral Hive consists
of three boxes placed
side by side (C. A. C), with
an octagonal box B on the
top which covers a bell-glass.
Each of the three boxes is 9
inches high, 9 inches wide,
and 11 inches from back
to front; thin wooden partitions,&mdash;in which six or seven openings corresponding
with each other are made&mdash;divide these compartments,
so that free access from one
box to the other is afforded
to the bees; this communication is stopped when necessary by a
zinc slide passing down between each box. The octagonal cover B
is about 10 inches in diameter and 20 high, including the sloping
octagonal roof, surmounted with an acorn as a finish. There are
two large windows in each of the end boxes, and one smaller one in
the centre box; across the latter is a thermometer scaled and
marked, so as to be an easy guide to the bee-master, showing him
by the rise in temperature the increased accommodation required.
This thermometer is a fixture, the indicating part being protected
by two pieces of glass, to prevent the bees from coming between it
and the window, and thereby obstructing the view.</p>

<p>D D are ventilators. In the centre of each of the end boxes is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span>
double zinc tube reaching down a little below the middle, the outer
tube is a casing of plain zinc, with holes about a quarter of an inch
wide dispersed over it; the inside one is of perforated zinc, with
openings so small as to prevent the escape of the bees, a flange or
rim keeps the tubes suspended through a hole made to receive it.
The object in having double tubing, is to allow the inner one to be
drawn up and the perforations to be opened by pricking out the
wax, or rather the propolis, with which bees close all openings
in their hives. These tubes admit a thermometer enclosed in a
cylindrical glass, to be occasionally inserted during the gathering
season; it requires to be left in the tube for about a quarter of an
hour; and on its withdrawal, if found indicating 90 degrees or more,
ventilation must be adopted to lower the temperature&mdash;the ornamental
zinc top D must be left raised, and is easily kept in that
position by putting the perforated part a little on one side.</p>

<p>The boxes before described are placed on a raised double floor-board,
extending the whole length, viz., about 36 inches. The
floor-board projects a few inches in front. In the centre is the
entrance;&mdash;as our engraving only shows the back of the hive, we
must imagine it on the other side,&mdash;it is made by cutting a sunken
way of about half-an-inch deep and 3 inches wide, in the floor-board
communicating only with the middle box; it is through
this entrance alone that the bees find their way into the hive,&mdash;access
to the end boxes and the super being obtained from the
inside. An alighting board is fitted close under the entrance for
the bees to settle upon when returning laden with honey; this
alighting board is removable for the convenience of packing. The
centre, or stock-box, A, called by Mr. Nutt the Pavilion of Nature,
is the receptacle for the swarm; for stocking this, it will be
necessary to tack the side tins so as to close the side openings in the
partition, and to tack some perforated zinc over the holes at top; the
swarm may then be hived into it just the same as with a common
hive. A temporary bottom-board may be used if the box has to be
sent any distance; or a cloth may be tied round to close the bottom
(the latter plan is best, because allowing plenty of air), and when
brought home at night, the bees being clustered at the top, the cloth
or temporary bottom must be removed, and the box gently placed on
its own floor-board, and the hive set in the place it is permanently
to occupy. E E are two block fronts which open with a hinge, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span>
semicircular hole 3 inches long, 2 wide in the middle, is cut in the
upper bottom-board immediately under the window of each box;
these apertures are closed by separate perforated zinc slides; these
blocks, when opened, afford a ready means of reducing the temperature
of the side boxes, a current of air being quickly obtained, and are
also useful for allowing the bees to throw out any refuse.</p>

<p>The centre F is a drawer in which is a feeding trough, so constructed
that the bees can descend through the opening before
mentioned on to a false bottom of perforated zinc; liquid food is
readily poured in by pulling out the drawer a little way, the bees
come down on to the perforated zinc and take the food by inserting
their proboscis through the perforations, with no danger
of being drowned. Care must be exercised that the food is not
given in such quantity as to come above the holes; by this means,
each hive has a supply of food accessible only to the inmates, with
no possibility, when closely shut in, of attracting robber bees from
other hives.</p>

<p>The exterior of these hives is <i>well</i> painted with two coats of lead
colour, covered with two coats of green, and varnished. Notwithstanding
this preservation, it is absolutely essential to place such a
hive under a shed or cover of some sort, as the action of the sun and
rain is likely to cause the wood to decay, whilst the extreme heat of
a summer sun might cause the combs to fall from their foundations.</p>

<p>Neat and tasteful sheds may be erected, either of zinc supported
by iron or wooden rods, or a thatched roof may be supported in the
same manner, and will form a pretty addition to the flower garden.</p>

<p>When erecting a covering, it will be well to make it a foot or
two longer, so as to allow of a cottage hive on either side, as the
appearance of the whole is much improved by such an arrangement.</p>

<p>The following directions, with some adaptation, are from "Nutt
on Honey Bees:"&mdash;</p>

<p>In the middle box the bees are to be first placed;&mdash;in it they
should first construct their beautiful combs, and under the government
of one sovereign&mdash;the mother of the hive&mdash;carry on their
curious work, and display their astonishing architectural ingenuity.
In this box, the <i>regina</i> of the colony, surrounded by her industrious,
happy, humming subjects, carries on the propagation of her species,
deposits in the cells prepared for the purpose by the other bees,
thousands of eggs, though she seldom deposits more than one egg in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span>
a cell at a time: these eggs are nursed up into a numerous progeny
by the other inhabitants of the hive. It is at this time, when
hundreds of young bees are daily coming into existence, that the
collateral boxes are of the utmost importance&mdash;both to the bees
domiciled in them, and to their proprietors; for when the brood
become perfect bees in a common cottager's hive, a swarm is the
necessary consequence. The queen, accompanied by a vast number
of her subjects, leaves the colony, and seeks some other place in
which to carry on the work nature has assigned her. But as
swarming may by proper precaution and attention to this mode of
management generally be prevented, it is good practice to do so;
because the time necessarily required to establish a new colony, even
supposing the cottager succeeds in saving the swarm, would otherwise
be employed in collecting honey, and in enriching the old hive.
Here, then, is one of the features of this plan&mdash;viz., <i>the prevention
of swarming</i>. When symptoms of swarming begin to present
themselves, which may be known by an unusual noise, the appearance
of more than common activity among the bees in the middle
box, and, above all, by a sudden rise of temperature, which will be
indicated by the quicksilver in the thermometer rising to 75 degrees
as scaled on the thermometer in the box; when these symptoms are
apparent, the bee master may conclude that additional space is
required. The top sliding tin should now be withdrawn from under
the bell glass, which will open to the bees a new store-room; this they
will soon occupy, and fill with combs and honey of pure whiteness,
if the weather be fine to allow of their uninterrupted labour. It
may be well here to mention, that if the glass have a small piece of
clean worker comb attached to the perforated ventilating tube, the bees
will more speedily commence their operations in it. When the glass is
nearly filled, which in a good season will be in a very short space of
time, the bees will again require increased accommodation; this will
also be indicated by the thermometer further rising to 85; the end box,
as thereon marked, must now be given them. Previously to drawing
up a slide to enlarge their crowded house, the manager should take
off the empty end box he intends to open to them, carefully and
thoroughly cleanse it, and then smear or dress the inside of it with
a little liquid honey. Thus prepared, he must return the box to its
proper situation, and then withdraw the sliding tin that hitherto has
cut it off from the middle box; by so doing the store-room is again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">- 21 -</span>
enlarged. The bees will commence operations in this new apartment.
This simple operation, done at the proper time, generally prevents
swarming; by it, the queen gains a vast addition to her dominions,
and, consequently, increasing space for the multiplying population of
her domicile. Provided the weather continue fine, and the thermometer
has risen to 95 degrees, as marked on the scale, the remaining
tin may be also withdrawn, thereby giving the bees, admittance to
another box; there is now no lack of store-rooms nor of employment
for our indefatigable labourers. The cylinder thermometer is
required to be occasionally dropped into the ventilating tube of the
side boxes to ascertain their temperature; for if exceeding or
approaching that of the middle box, it must be reduced by ventilating;
this is done by raising the zinc tops, to allow the air to pass through
the perforations. The grand object of this system is to keep the end
boxes and the bell glass cooler than the pavilion or middle box, so as to
induce the queen to propagate her species there and there only, and
not in the depriving part of the hive; by this means the side and
upper combs are in no way discoloured by brood. The queen requires
a considerable degree of warmth; the middle box does not require
more ventilation than the additional openings afford. The bees
enjoy coolness in the side boxes, and thereby the whiteness and
purity of the luscious store are increased.</p>

<p>After having given directions for the working of the hive, it
remains to be told how to obtain possession of the store, and to get rid
of our industrious tenants from the super and end boxes, of which
the super glass will be almost sure to be filled first, having been first
given to them. The operation of taking honey is best performed in
the middle of a fine sunny day. The best mode that we know of is to
pass an ordinary table-knife all round underneath the rim of the glass
to loosen the cement, properly called propolis; then take a piece of fine
wire, or a piece of string will do, and, having hold of the two ends, draw
it under the glass very slowly, so as to allow the bees to get out of the
way. Having brought the string through, the glass is now separated
from the hive; but it is well to leave the glass in its place for an
hour or so, the commotion of the bees will then have subsided; and
another advantage we find is, that the bees suck up the liquid and
seal up the cells broken by the cutting off. You can then pass underneath
the glass two pieces of tin or zinc; the one may be the proper
slide to prevent the inmates of the hive coming out at the apertures,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span>
the other tin keeps all the bees in the glass close prisoners.
After having been so kept a short time, the apiarian must see whether
the bees in the glass manifest symptoms of uneasiness, because if they
do not, it may be concluded that the queen is among them. In such
a case, replace the glass, and recommence the operation on a future
day. It is not often that her majesty is in the depriving hive or
glass; but this circumstance does sometimes happen, and the
removal at such a time must be avoided. When the bees that
are prisoners run about in great confusion and restlessness, the
operator may then conclude that the queen is absent, and that all is
right. The glass may be taken away a little distance off, and placed
in a flower-pot or other receptacle where it will be safe when
inverted and the tin taken away, then the bees will be glad to
make their escape back to their hive. A little tapping at the sides
of the glass will render their tarriance uncomfortable, and the glass
may then be taken into a darkened room or out-house with only a
small aperture admitting light which must be open; the bees, like
all insects, make towards the light and so escape. The bee-master
should brush them off with a feather from the comb as they can be
reached; but on no account, if there are many bees, should the glass
be left, because the bees that are in the glass will gorge themselves
to their full and speedily bring a host of others from the adjacent
hives, who, in a very little time, would leave only the empty combs.
It is truly marvellous how soon they will carry all the store back
again, if allowed to do so. An empty glass should be put on to the
hive in place of the full one, as it will attract the bees up, thereby
preventing the too close crowding of the hive; and, if the summer
be not too far advanced, they will work more honey-comb in it.</p>

<p>The taking away of the end boxes is a somewhat similar process;
but they should on no account be taken at the same time as the
glass, or indeed at the same time as any other hive may be&mdash;<i>robbed</i>
we were going to say, for it is robbery to the bees,&mdash;they intended
the honey for their winter food, and are much enraged at being
deprived of it. First shut down the dividing tin; the bees in the
end box are now prisoners separated from the hive, keep them so
half an hour, then take away the box bodily to another part of the
garden, or into the dark out-house as before recommended.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to say something respecting
the enthusiastic inventor of the Collateral Hive&mdash;Thomas Nutt,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
who was an inhabitant of Spalding, in Lincolnshire. Having
been disabled during a considerable period by rheumatic fever,
he devoted all his attention to bees, at a time when bee-culture
was but little valued; and, although it must be admitted
that two boxes were used side by side long before Mr. Nutt's day,
still it is due to him to state that the adoption of three boxes was
entirely his own idea, and that as far as he then knew, the collateral
system was his original invention. His statements have been severely
criticised, and it does appear that the weight of honey which he
names as having been produced in one season is perfectly incredible.
But as in the district where he lived there is grown an immense
quantity of mustard seed&mdash;the flowers of which afford excellent forage
for bees&mdash;the honey harvests there, would doubtless, be very large.
If Mr. Nutt has given his little favourites too much praise, it will be
only charitable, now, to account for his statements by an excess of
zeal and enthusiasm in this his study of bee-culture. It may be that
the golden harvests he spoke and wrote of have been so far useful
that they have induced many to commence bee-keeping, some of
whom, whilst they condemned his statements, have themselves written
really useful and practical works on the subject, which otherwise
might possibly never have appeared. As the monks of old kept
the lamp of religion burning, however dimly, until a more enlightened
age, so Thomas Nutt may have assisted in a somewhat similar
manner by energetically propounding his views, and thereby causing
other apiarians to rise up whose names are now as familiar to us as
household words, and whose works posterity will value. The writer
of these pages has often accompanied Mr. Nutt on his visits to his
patrons in the neighbourhood of London, and seen him perform
his operations regardless of the anger of bees, and free from all
fear of their stings. He often expatiated on the cruelty of the
brimstone match and suffocation, denouncing the barbarous custom
in the following terms:&mdash;"You may as well kill the cow for her
milk, or the hen for her eggs, as the bee for its honey; why continue
to light the fatal match, when every cottager in England has the
means of saving this most useful and valuable insect?"</p>

<p id="Neighbors_Imp_Hive" class="caption3">NEIGHBOUR'S IMPROVED SINGLE BOX HIVE. No. 2.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page24" style="width: 182px;">
  <img src="images/page24.png" width="182" height="516" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We have introduced the "Single Box
Hive" to suit the convenience of those
who, though desirous of keeping bees on
the improved principle, do not wish to
incur the expense or devote the space
which is necessary for Nutt's hive.</p>

<p>It consists of a lower or stock-box A.,
11 inches square, 9 inches deep, with
three large windows, a thermometer D, as
in Nutt's, being fixed across the front one,
protected at the sides by strips of glass to
prevent the bees obscuring the quicksilver
from sight. B is a cover the same size as the
lower hive, large enough to allow space for
a bell-glass 9 inches wide, 6 inches deep.
E is the ventilator between the glass and the
stock-hive, intended to prevent the queen
travelling into the super hive, and also by
cooling the hive to endeavour to prevent
swarming; a sloping pagoda roof with an
acorn top completes the upper story. A
floor-board with a block front, as in Nutt's
collateral, forms the base, the entrance being
sunk as before described, and furnished
with zinc slides to reduce or close it as may
be required. To stock a hive of this description, it is necessary to send
the stock-box to the party with whom you have agreed for the supply
of a swarm. In the evening of the day the hive is thus tenanted,
remove it to the position it is designed permanently to occupy;
if the swarm has to be procured from a distance, and is transported
by rail or other conveyance, a perforated zinc slide should be substituted
for the plain slide that covers the top, and a large piece of
perforated zinc must also be tacked to the bottom after the swarm
has settled in; thus securely confined, with a free circulation of air
throughout, bees that have been swarmed the day before may be
safely sent any distance that will allow of their being released
the day after, because bees, though they provision themselves for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">- 25 -</span>
a couple of days, cannot with safety be confined in an empty hive
much longer.</p>

<p>Having now, we will suppose, procured your swarm, and having
placed it in a south or south-east aspect, you may with advantage,
if the weather be wet, give a little liquid food; the feeding in this
hive is performed at the top of stock-box, where the glass is
worked. Our round Feeding Pan or the new Feeding-Bottle
may here be used. Any fancy as to the position may be indulged
in, but must be settled on by the time the bees are set at liberty,
because any alteration afterwards is detrimental to the working of
the hive. The bees on first issuing forth, carefully mark their new
abode and the surrounding objects, so that if a change be made,
they are completely thrown out in their observations, which confuses
them not a little, and occasions loss. Bees always return to the
same spot; it is the locality that they know, and if the hive is
moved a less distance than a mile, thousands return to the spot on
which the hive has been accustomed to stand.</p>

<p>Allow your bees to collect honey and build their combs for ten
days or a fortnight. Much now depends on the weather; if fine,
by this time they will require additional room, which will be indicated
by the thermometer D rapidly rising; 100 degrees is the
swarming point, the hive must be kept below this by ventilation.</p>

<p>Access must now be given to the flat bell-glass at the top, which
is done by withdrawing the top slide. In a few hours, sometimes
immediately, the work of comb-building begins in the glass&mdash;all the
sooner, if a piece of clean empty comb be placed therein.</p>

<p>It is of service to keep the glass warm by means of a worsted or
baize bag, it prevents the temperature from falling at night when
much comb-building is carried on, providing the heat is not allowed to
escape. Probably, if all goes on well, in three weeks the glass will
be found to be filled with fine white honey-comb. When you find
that the comb is well sealed up, it is time to take it off, but if the
cells are unfilled and unsealed, let the little labourers complete their
work&mdash;a little experience will soon enable the bee-keeper to determine
this point.</p>

<p>The plan to be adopted for taking glasses of honey-comb is the
same as described for <a href="#Page_21">hive No. 1, page 21</a>.</p>

<p>Taylor's Amateur Hive, as seen
by reference to the engraving, consists
of three boxes, the lower one
A, is the stock box, in which the
swarm is first placed; B is the first
super; and C the centre box; all
three boxes are of the same diameter,
viz., 13&frac12; inches square inside; A, the
stock box, is 7&frac12; deep; B, 6&frac12; inches;
both are fitted with eight moveable
bars, each bar being 1&#8539; wide, with
spaces of half an inch between, and
all are easily removed by unscrewing
the crown board, in which are two
openings closed by zinc slides; the middle
box C has no bars, and is still shallower
than either of the other boxes, being 5
inches deep. In many localities and
seasons, the third box may not be required. Each box has two windows&mdash;one
at the back and another at the
side, a zinc shutter sliding in a groove,
excluding light and retaining warmth;
the box C differs from the others in another
respect; instead of bars it has a grating
made by seven openings, each &frac12;
an inch wide and 9 inches long; these
three boxes stand on a stout floor-board,
in which is cut the entrance way, 4
inches wide and &#8540; of an inch high. The
floor-board projects so as to support an
outer cover of half-inch wood, surmounted
by a sloping roof. This is an effectual
protection from the weather, and is necessary when hives are exposed; of course,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">- 27 -</span>
if placed in a bee-house such protection may be dispensed with.
The outer case is well painted, of a green colour, and when it is used
the hive may be placed in any part of the garden. The dimensions of
this hive, with outside cover, are 18 inches square, 2 feet 6 inches high.</p>

<p>Suitable stands are provided, consisting of a stout pedestal with
four feet. Stakes should be driven into the ground to secure the
whole against wind. Height from the ground, 4 feet 3 inches.</p>

<p>The bars before alluded to are for the purpose of inducing the
bees to build parallel combs; for without this, extraction would be
impossible. It is a great convenience, in many ways, to be able to
take out a bar of comb, it gives such complete control over the
hive.</p>

<p>To ensure comb-building on the bars, pieces of clean worker
comb should always be carefully preserved; and before a swarm is
put in, either every bar, or if guide comb is not plentiful, every
other bar should have a piece fixed to it in the following manner:
cut a piece of clean empty comb of the required size, say two
inches square, not less; heat a common flat iron, and slightly warm
the bar with it, then melt a little bees-wax upon it; draw the comb
quick over the heated iron, hold it down on the centre of the bar,
giving a very slight movement backwards and forwards, then leave
it to grow cold; and if cleverly managed, it will be found to be
firmly attached. Care must be taken that the pitch or inclination
of the comb be the same as it is in the hives&mdash;upwards from the
centre of each comb. A new plan has lately been introduced by
Mr. Woodbury, of Exeter, to facilitate the correct construction of
parallel combs.</p>


<p id="Taylors_Am_Bar_Hive" class="caption3">TAYLOR'S AMATEUR BAR HIVE. No. 4.</p>

<p>Taylor's Amateur Bar Hive is stocked exactly in the same way
as before described&mdash;viz., by hiving the swarm into the lowest box
A, as with an ordinary Cottage Hive, and in a fortnight's time the box
B is placed over it, and the zinc slides withdrawn. After this has
been given them, and is nearly filled, the super B is raised, and the
box C is placed between, immediately over the stock box, to induce
the bees to continue the combs.</p>

<p>This hive consists of three boxes, one above the other, similar to
the No. 3. The boxes are less in diameter than the foregoing, and have
seven moveable bars in each. Recent improvements and observations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">- 28 -</span>
led Mr. Taylor to prefer eight bars, and to have the boxes made a
little more shallow.</p>

<p>The mode of stocking and management of this hive are the
same as that last described. There is no outside cover or protection
from the weather, but the wood is additionally thick and is well
painted.</p>

<p>We quite concur with Mr. Taylor in recommending a broader
and shallower hive, and advise intending purchasers to select the
eight-bar hive in preference.</p>

<p>Our "Improved Cottage Hive" is
neatly made of straw bound with cane, and
therefore very durable.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The lower hive is
covered with a wooden top having in it
three holes, through which the bees convey
their honey into three middle sized bell
glasses with ventilators, which when filled
hold about 6 lb. each. There is a hoop at
the bottom, another round the top of the
lower hive; to this the wooden crown board
is fastened. These hoops are a great improvement,
and are less liable to harbour
insects than if straw alone were used. The
floor-board, as its name implies, is a
wooden board, 1&frac14; inch thick, with a projection
of 3 or 4 inches under the entrance
to form an alighting place. This entrance
is cut out of, or sunk in the board.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> This is the hive referred to by the Bee-Master of the Times, when he
says:&mdash;"The second kind of hive I alluded to is made of straw, and may be
purchased at Neighbour's, in Holborn. * * * * It is so well made that it
will last very long. I have had one in constant use during ten years, and it
is still as good us when it was bought."</p>

</div>

<p>There are three windows in the lower
hive, each closed with a shutter, these
are very useful and interesting for inspecting
the progress made. Across the
centre window is a thermometer, enclosed at the sides by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">- 29 -</span>
slips of glass. The window shutters being painted green, add
very much to its appearance. The upper hive, which is merely a cover
for the glasses, is a conical topped hive, also made of straw bound
with cane; a hoop is worked into the straw, and made sufficiently
large to allow the cover to drop over the top hoop of the lower
hive, keeping the whole close, and preventing wet from drifting in. A
zinc ventilator, ornamentally painted, forms the apex: this is useful
in letting the confined hot air pass away in warm weather. The
ventilator is opened by raising it. The dimensions of the lower or
stock hive are 15 inches diameter, 9&frac12; inches deep outside, its weight
when empty 7&frac12; lbs., the cover or top hive is 12 inches deep, and
15 inches in diameter, the ornamental zinc top being 4 inches deep.
The whole is about 24 inches high. The weight of a hive packed,
including glasses, &amp;c., is about 18 lbs.</p>

<p>These hives have a tasteful appearance in the garden, but they
require some further protection from the weather in the form of a
cover or of a bee-house&mdash;contrivances that have yet to be described.
In extreme cold weather, a little additional protection by having
matting folded round them will be advisable.</p>

<p>One of the advantages this hive has over the common cottage
hive is that it affords opportunity for the humane management of
bees. The owner has also the power of taking a glass of honey-comb
of pure quality, free from the extraneous matter, known as "bee-bread,"
instead of combs that are darkened by having brood hatched
in them. By this system, we have combs newly made and used
only for depositing the honey first put into them, hence the name
"virgin honey." These glasses have a very pretty appearance,
and when nicely filled, are very convenient for home use or for
making presents. The lower hive is the receptacle for the bees;
when a swarm is placed in this hive, they immediately proceed to
fill it with combs, in which to store honey for themselves, and for
cells to breed in. This hive remains undisturbed.</p>

<p>The best mode of tenanting a hive of this description is by
placing an early and strong swarm in it, which may be generally
procured of a neighbouring bee-keeper; if from a distance, considerable
care is necessary to admit plenty of air; the shaking attendant
upon carriage irritates the bees so much that, if not well ventilated,
there is danger of the swarm being stifled, and the finer the swarm,
the greater the danger. For the purpose of ventilation, remove the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span>
slides and substitute perforated zinc, wrapping the hive up in a
coarse cloth of open texture (dispensing with the floor-board during
transit when the distance is great).</p>

<p>It is necessary only to send the lower or stock hive to the party
furnishing the swarm, taking the precaution to fix the slides at top
with tacks, as the hive has to be inverted to receive the bees. They
are shaken into it in the usual manner, as they cluster around the
branch of the tree or shrub on which they may have chosen to alight.
After the hiving is accomplished, the hive should be left near to
catch any stragglers, for there will always be a few; towards
evening, close the entrance, and remove them to the exact position
they are intended permanently to occupy. Success depends on this, and
also on their careful removal on the day or evening of swarming.
The following morning the bees labour in the new location, marking
well their habitation before they take flight, and to which they
will not fail to return loaded with luscious store.</p>

<p>A fortnight must be allowed for filling the stock hive; then,
if the weather be fine and warm, they will prepare to swarm again,
as will be indicated by the thermometer rising rapidly to 100
degrees or upwards; one of the zinc slides on the wooden top
must now be withdrawn, and a bell glass put on covered and protected
by the upper hive, the other glasses may then be given
in the same manner; a day or two after which, should the weather
continue favourable, all signs of swarming will at once disappear,
the bees now having increased store room which they will readily
fill with comb. It is often found useful to attach a piece of
clean empty honey comb to the ventilating tube of the glass; it is
an attraction, and induces the bees to commence working in it sooner
than they otherwise would do. The ventilator should also remain
open during the day to allow the hot air to pass away from the interior,
thereby contributing to the whiteness and beauty of the work; the bees
enjoy the refreshment of coolness thereby afforded, and they work the
faster for it. At evening all ventilation should be stopped, and the
glasses wrapped round with flannel or some warm material, for
the reasons mentioned on <a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>.</p>

<p>The directions for taking honey are also the same as before
mentioned.</p>

<p>The holes on the wooden top of this hive are of a peaked shape,
being a preventive against slaughtering any bees whilst pushing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">- 31 -</span>
slide in for the purpose of removing the glass when full; the tacks
before alluded to should be removed from the slides when the hive
is fixed in its place, they are now in the way of cutting off the glass.
The hive entrance has two slides: the perforated one is but seldom
required, the bees object to being closely confined, it is only
necessary when removing, and then for as little time as possible;
the other slide is very serviceable during the winter months to lessen
the passage way, thereby preventing the admission of too much cold
air; it is also occasionally useful on a summer evening, to lessen
the entrance when moths are troublesome, for if there be only a
small opening, the bees can guard it, and easily repulse intruders.
During the time of gathering they require the whole width to remain
open.</p>

<p>When the weather is so unfavourable as to prevent the bees
leaving home for a few days after being hived, it will be necessary
to feed them. Bees should not be fed in the midst of winter; the
proper time is in the autumn or in the spring.</p>

<p>The best mode of feeding is at the top of the Stock Hive. This
is done by using the Round Feeder.</p>

<p>The Bottle Feeder may be used instead of the Round Feeder, and
in the same place, by those who give the preference to that method.</p>

<p>The simplicity and easy management of this hive have deservedly
rendered it an especial favourite, combining, as it does, real utility
with many conveniences to satisfy the curious. Not a few bee-keepers
desire to unite the two qualifications, and no hive combines
these advantages in a greater degree than "Neighbour's Improved
Cottage Hive."</p>


<p id="Imp_Cott_Hive" class="caption3">IMPROVED COTTAGE HIVE. No. 6.</p>

<p>The No. 6 hive is of precisely the same size, construction, and
management as the last mentioned, with the exception that it has no
windows or thermometer in the lower or stock hive. The apiarian
with this hive will have to trust more to his own judgment as
regards the likelihood of swarming, and must watch the appearance
the bees present at the entrance. When it is time to put on supers
in order to prevent swarming, premonition will be given by the
unusual numbers crowding about the entrance, as well as by the
heat of the weather, making it evident that more room is required
for the increasing population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">- 32 -</span></p>

<p>Not being able to form an idea of the state of the hive in spring
and autumn by looking into the stock hive, it will be advisable to
adopt the means of weighing. A stock at Michaelmas should
weigh 20 lbs. exclusive of the hive, or be made up to that weight
by feeding.</p>

  <img src="images/page32.png" width="186" height="249" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This engraving illustrates the construction
of the "Ladies Observatory"
hive. The stock hive cylindrical with a flat
top and a hole in the centre; the dimensions
12&frac12; inches inside, 8&frac12; inches deep,
the outer cover being raised, and is made
of stout glass, so as not easily to break.</p>

<p>A support, composed of seven wooden
bars fixed on a pedestal from the floorboard,
is very useful for the bees to cling
to and attach their combs, instead of
resting wholly against the glass.</p>

<p>The floor-board is of mahogany, the
border being French polished. A middle sized bell-glass for
deprivation is placed over the hole; this hole may be closed by a
zinc slide. A cover of straw, 18 inches deep, 15 inches wide, with
a zinc ventilating top similar to that affixed to the No. 5 hive,
completes the arrangements. The weight of the stock hive and
board is about 16 lbs.</p>

<p>This hive is well adapted for those persons who are desirous of
having the opportunity of more closely examining the workmanship
of these industrious and interesting insects, as the whole of the
interior may be exposed to view; it is particularly suitable for a
window or an indoor apiary, and also will be found a valuable
addition to the green house. Under these circumstances, the
entrance-way should be covered with a flat piece of glass, and
an aperture cut in the sash corresponding with the entrance to the
hive; through the glazed passage the bees may then find egress and
ingress without being able to gain access to the apartment; an
alighting board four inches wide must be fixed outside on a level
with the entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">- 33 -</span></p>

<p>We had a hive of this kind in operation in the Great Exhibitions
of 1851 and 1862, fixed in the manner above described. It
answered admirably, and excited much interest and curiosity, though
placed there under many disadvantages.</p>

<p>When a hive of this kind is to be stocked, procure an early and
strong swarm, which must be temporarily hived in a common straw
hive, from which dislodge the bees into the glass hive, but for this
purpose a little preparation will have to be made. Spread a
sheet on the ground, place the mahogany floorboard on it with
the support, put three bricks, or some solid blocks of about the
same substance, upon which the glass will rest; then with a
sharp and sudden blow precipitate the swarm out of the straw hive
on to the floorboard and support, place the glass hive on the bricks,
and the bees will collect under the bars and on to the pedestal. In
about one hour's time the whole will have settled quietly, and all
the stragglers on the board will have collected together, the swarm
hanging pear-shaped from the bar support; the bricks can now be
removed, and the glass put in its right place on the floorboard.
The straw cover being put on the hive, it can be removed to the
place it is destined permanently to occupy.</p>

<p>The light should not be admitted for some days after hiving;
if undisturbed, the bees will speedily build comb, working from the
wooden bars which are placed there for their assistance and support.
In ten days or a fortnight, if the weather continues fine and warm,
they will prepare to swarm again; the opening at the top must now
be unstopped, and the bell-glass put on, guide comb having been
previously fixed. The directions given for the No. 5, Cottage Hive
equally apply to the Ladies' Observatory Hive.</p>

<p>It is advisable in winter to furnish the glass stock hive with
more protection from cold than is afforded by the straw cover
alone; some thick baize or wrapper of wadding, for which there is
space between the glass hive and the cover, will prevent so much
moisture condensing on the sides of the glass. Moisture is injurious,
causing the combs to grow mouldy; a little protection in the way
of wrapping very much prevents this.</p>

<p>The hole at top is used for supplying food should the apiarian
fear the stock of honey is in danger of running short; either the
bottle feeder, or the round feeder, may be used for the purpose.</p>

<p class="caption4">FOR TAKING HONEY IN STRAW CAPS WITHOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEES.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page34" style="width: 202px;">
  <img src="images/page34.png" width="202" height="261" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A very prevalent opinion exists
that bees do better in straw than in
hives made of any other material.
Another opinion prevails, viz., that
the old fashioned straw hive is the
least expensive, the most simple, and
the most productive. Although we
cannot go so far as this, we are
willing to admit that a simplified
adaptation of the humane system to
the old common straw hive is the
most suitable to put into the hands
of that large class of bee-keepers&mdash;<i>Cottagers</i>.
By these the more fanciful hives will be instantly
condemned; besides, the expense puts them quite beyond the
reach of the poorer class. The object aimed at in planning our
Cottager's Hive has been to furnish a depriving hive that should be at
once easy of management, inexpensive, and convenient. The stock
hive, into which the bees are first hived, is a round straw hive,
having a flat top with a hole in the centre. The size of this
lower hive is 7 or 8 inches deep, 14 inches across the bottom,
finished with a wooden hoop, which adds very much to the firmness
and durability of the hive. The floorboard is 1&frac14; inch thick, with a
way sunk therein for the entrance. A small round mat of straw
closes the hole on the top; this mat may be fixed by wooden
pegs. We have now described what is termed the <i>stock hive</i>, which
is, in fact, an old fashioned straw hive adapted, modernised, and
improved to the more humane, viz., the depriving system. The
weight of the stock hive with its floorboard is about 7 lbs.</p>

<p>The super or cap hive is about 7 inches deep, 8 inches in
diameter, and when filled contains about 10 lbs. of honey and
comb. A glass window which is placed at the side is useful for inspecting
the progress made in filling it.</p>

<p>A common straw hive, sufficiently deep to cover, drops over the
super, keeping the window dark and fitting close on to the stock hive.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">- 35 -</span>
This cover hive may be made fast by driving in two skewers, one on
either side, to keep the whole firm. Unless placed in a bee-house or
under a shed, the outside should be painted; or a piece of oil-cloth
or waterproof covering of any kind shaped so as to shoot off the
rain, will save the trouble of paint, and answer the purpose. If no
protection of this sort is used, the rain is likely to rot the straw.
As a covering cottagers often use straight stiff thatching straw sewed
together; this contrivance is termed a hackle, and has a pretty
appearance, particularly if a number of hives are in a row. Care has
to be exercised that mice do not make the covering hive a resting
place. Mortar is often used for fastening round the hive at the
bottom; this is a bad plan, as it forms a harbour for insects; the
wooden hoop fits so close as to leave little necessity for anything of
the kind.</p>

<p>The principle of the depriving system is so much the same with
all our hives, that a good deal of repetition is necessary in describing
in detail the management of each separate variety. The object
aimed at with the Cottager's Hive, as indeed with all our hives, is
to provide a compartment for the bees to live in with their queen,
she being the mother of all. It is intended, by inducing the queen
to remain in her original apartment, that all breeding should be there
performed, as well as the storing of bee-bread and honey for the
winter sustenance of the bees. The cap hive or upper chamber,
known as the "super," is for the storing of honey which the bee-keeper
looks upon as a surplus, and which, at the close of the honey
gathering, or as soon as filled, he intends to deprive the bees of, and
appropriate to his own use,&mdash;of course taking care to leave sufficient
in the lower or stock hive for winter sustenance.</p>

<p>The mode of stocking a hive of this kind is so familiarly known
that any who at all understand the hiving of bees into a common
straw hive, can make no mistake or find any difficulty in performing
it. Lest these pages should fall into the hands of persons who are
not so acquainted, we will refer them to the directions already given.</p>

<p>The hive may be smeared inside with a little honey if at hand;
but this is unimportant, as a clean hive answers well. Some
older bee-keepers prefer to give a little dressing to encourage the
bees to like their new home.</p>

<p>After the swarm has been in the hive two weeks, the straw
super hive may be put on, first removing the straw mat to give the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span>
bees access to it. If the hive be a stock, that is a swarm of the
last or previous years, the super may be put on as soon as the
weather is fine and warm in May. But much depends on the weather
and the strength of the hive as regards the time occupied by the
bees in filling the super; in favourable weather a fortnight suffices.</p>

<p>If, on looking in at the little window, the bee-master sees that
the cells are scaled over, the cap of honey may be removed in the
mode already described. The cells near the window are the last to
be filled, so when they are sealed, it is safe to conclude that the
combs in the unseen parts are also finished.</p>

<p>Sometimes the queen ascends and deposits her eggs; if, on
turning up the super, brood be visible, replace the cap for a few
days, until the young bees quit their cells. When thus emptied,
honey will be deposited in lieu of the brood.</p>

<p>Suitable pedestals for these hives to stand upon may be obtained.
It is important that these be firmly fixed, and the hive also made
fast to the stand, to prevent its being blown over by high winds.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury's Bar and Frame
Hive, as originally made, consists of a
wooden box 14&frac12; inches square inside,
9 inches deep. This is a hive of large
size, but the actual habitable space
inside is lessened by the room occupied
by the frames, of which there are ten;
these rest on a rabbet a little below the
surface, leaving a space of &#8540; of an inch between the upper side of the
bars and the crown board. This allows a free passage on the top for
the bees, entirely obviating the necessity of making excavations in
the crown board, as has hitherto been recommended. Each frame
is &#8542; of an inch wide, and rests in notches, with a space of &frac12; an inch
between each. The frames extend to within &#8540; of an inch of the
floorboard, so as to hang without touching any part, leaving about the
same distance from the sides. It will be seen that there is a free
passage for the bees on every side, and they are thus kept from
coming in contact with the sides of the hive. Our engraving shows
the hive open, and exposes to view the top of the ten bars and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">- 37 -</span>
frames as they range from back to front. A window is also shown;
this is placed in the engraving over the entrance, but the proper
position would be just opposite. The drawing is made so as to
show back and front at once. The floorboard is 1&frac14; inch thick,
having two "keys" on the underside to prevent warping.</p>

</div>

<p>Since the introduction of
the wood hive by Mr. Woodbury,
that gentleman has recommended,
in the <i>Journal of
Horticulture</i>, that the stock
hive be made of straw, of
exactly the same dimensions;
this material being warmer in
winter, slightly ventilating,
and allowing of absorption. Bees during cold weather cluster
together to generate the requisite degree of heat, the temperature
of the interior of the hive being thus so much higher than the
external atmosphere, a good deal of moisture condenses at the
top and on the sides of the hive; the straw, as before stated,
prevents this dampness hanging about the hive, and tends to keep
the inmates more healthy. Dampness in a hive is a fruitful source
of mischief, causing empty combs to grow mouldy, and is injurious
in many ways.</p>

<p>The square straw hives, and a machine for making them,
exhibited in the Austrian department of the International Exhibition
of 1862, suggested the idea of employing that material for English
bar and frame hives. We have had made a machine somewhat
similar to the one exhibited and suited to the size of our hives, by
which our hive maker is able to manufacture neat square straw
hives. These have a wood frame at top an inch deep, with the
requisite notches to allow the ten comb frames to hang. A similar
frame forms the base, the straw being worked between. The
floorboard is 1&frac14; inch thick, "keyed" with stout keys as before
mentioned. An inch projection is left on all sides beyond the
exterior of the hive, from which it is slightly chamfered down.
An entrance 4 inches wide is cut out of the substance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">- 38 -</span>
the board, beginning at the edge, and continuing on the same level
until inside the hive, where it slopes upwards. This entrance is
about &#8540; of an inch high where the hive crosses it.</p>

<p>These straw hives have been generally made without windows;
as Mr. Woodbury and other scientific apiarians so prefer them.
They consider that glass windows are unsuited for winter, because
then moisture condenses on the glass. There is no doubt that the
having a peep hole or two in a hive adds very agreeably to its value
for amateur bee-keepers, and to meet the wishes of such, we have
had straw hives constructed with windows. It is not every one who
would like to lift out the frames as often as is necessary for an
inspection of the state of the colony, nor, perhaps, is it advisable to
be often thus meddling. The windows have also a very neat appearance.
We have hives with one, and some with two and three
windows; of course, a little extra expense is incurred where these
are made; but that is not objected to by those who approve of the
additional convenience. The crown board (if correct to call a
straw top by that name) has, like the hive, a frame of wood all
round, and a square piece of wood in the centre, with a two inch
hole; this hole is for the purpose of administering food in a mode
to be explained hereafter. A circular block of wood, 4 inches in
diameter, closes the opening.</p>


<p id="Glass_Hive" class="caption4">GLASS BAR AND FRAME HIVES.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page38" style="width: 220px;">

</div>

<p>Some bee-keepers like to be able
to make a full and daily inspection of
the hive; we have therefore prepared
a few hives, constructed of wooden
frames enclosed on all sides and on
the top with window glass. The
dimensions are precisely the same as those before mentioned, and allow
of the same number of bars and frames (ten). The crown has a
round hole cut in the glass to admit of feeding. The four sides are
constructed of double glass, to preserve the bees from variations of
temperature. We cannot, however, recommend this hive for a winter
residence for the bees; we should prefer lifting the combs out with
the bees, and placing them in a straw hive of similar construction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">- 39 -</span>
to pass through the ordeal of the winter season. A stock of bees
might be kept through the year in a hive of this kind, but would
require well wrapping round to keep out the cold. There should be
a small glass over the hole at top so as to allow the moisture to arise
and condense, instead of doing so in the hive. The operation of
exchanging the hive is so easy, that we should be content to place
a stock in one, say, from April to September, and shift it in the
autumn. Such a hive is a very pleasing object of interest, as in it
the whole commonwealth of bees is exposed to view; and the hive
need not be obscured from daylight, provided it be protected from
sun and rain. All the external wood-work is of oak colour
varnished, so that the appearance of the "Glass Bar and Frame
Hive" is extremely neat and much approved of.</p>

<p id="Frame"><span class="smcap">Frame.</span>&mdash;As before mentioned, each stock
hive has ten of these frames, each 13 inches
long by 7&frac14; inches high, with a &#8541; inch projection
at either upper end, which rests in the notch,
either back or front. The width both of the bar and frame is &#8542; of an
inch; this is less by &frac14; of an inch than the bar recommended by the
older apiarians. Mr. Woodbury,&mdash;whose authority on the modern
plans for keeping bees is of great weight,&mdash;finds the &#8542; of an inch
bar an improvement, because with them the combs are closer
together, and require fewer bees to cover the brood. Then, too,
in the same space that eight old fashioned bars occupied the
narrower frames admit of an additional bar, so that, by using these,
increased accommodation is afforded for breeding and the storing of
honey.</p>

  <div class="figcaption">Section of bar.</div>
</div>

<p id="Comb_Bar"><span class="smcap">Improved Comb Bar.</span>&mdash;Mr. Woodbury says that this
little contrivance has proved very effectual in securing
straight combs when guide combs are not obtainable.
The lower angles are rounded off, whilst a central rib is
added of about &#8539; of an inch in breadth and depth.
This central rib extends to within &frac12; an inch of each
end, where it is removed in order to admit of the bar
fitting into the usual notch. All that is necessary to insure the
regular formation of combs is, to coat the underneath surface of the
central rib with melted wax. Mr. Woodbury further says, "my
practice is to use plain bars whenever guide-combs are attainable, as
these can be attached with much greater facility to a plain than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">- 40 -</span>
to a ribbed bar; but whenever I put in a bar without comb, I
always use one of the improved ones. By this method, crooked
and irregular combs are altogether unknown in my apiary."</p>

<p>Most of our bars are made with the ridge; but should any of our
customers prefer the flat ones, we keep a few to supply their
requirements.</p>

<p>With the moveable "bar and frame hive" every comb is available
for extraction, and may easily be taken out of the hive; each comb
being fixed within its frame, there is less disturbance to the bees
than if the combs were fixed to the sides, as is the case with ordinary
hives. A strip of wood, about &frac12; an inch wide, rests on the floorboard;
in this strip are ten notches, made to receive the lower part
of the frames, so as to retain them in their places at equal distances
from each other. A difficulty is found with a well stocked hive in
dropping the frames into the exact notches, so that it is not
necessary to have these rack works always in use; but when any
movement of the hive is made, it is essential to have the frames
firmly fixed by the aid of this contrivance. It is also advisable to
have the frames perpendicularly supported until the combs are built,
so in order that the frames should hang true, the hive ought to be
on the level. A little inclination may be given to it from back to
front, causing the hive slightly to fall towards the entrance, so as to
allow the moisture inside the hive, caused by the exhalations of the
bees, to run off.</p>

<p id="Comp_Bar_frame">"<span class="smcap">Compound Bar Frame.</span>"&mdash;In the <i>Journal
of Horticulture</i>, Mr. Woodbury thus describes
the compound bar frame. Being his own
adaptation, we cannot do better than use his
own words. "This is a contrivance of my own, which I have
found very advantageous in enabling me to use frames in stock hives
and bars in supers, without forfeiting the advantages arising from the
unlimited interchangeability of every comb in every hive and super
in the apiary. Its construction will be readily understood by an
inspection of the annexed sketch, in which the comb bar is shown
slightly raised from its frame. The bar itself is 13&frac14; inches long by
&#8542; of an inch wide and &#8540; of an inch thick. When the comb bar is
in its place, the whole forms a frame 13 inches long by 7&frac14; inches
high (inside measure), with &#8541; of an inch projection at each end, which
rests in its appropriate notch in either the back or front of the hive.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">- 41 -</span>
When filled with comb, the bar becomes so firmly cemented to the
frame as to admit of its being handled with facility." This contrivance
is, no doubt, very excellent in the hands of Mr. Woodbury;
but in the hands of the unpractised severe mishaps may arise. In
warm weather the propolis and wax, with which the bees cement
the bar to the frame, becomes soft, consequently in handling the
frames, unless dexterity is used, the comb is likely to drop out. We,
therefore, recommend that the bar and frame be made both in one:
greater firmness and simplicity are thereby gained. Some of these
compound bars and frames are kept in stock at our establishment,
though they cannot be recommended for general use; but should
any one prefer them, they can be supplied at the same price as
the common frames.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page41" style="width: 251px;">
  <img src="images/page41.png" width="251" height="143" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In describing the stock
hives of wood, straw, and
glass, allusion has frequently
been made to the depriving
hives, technically called
"supers." These are also
made of glass in wood frames,
13 inches inside, 6 inches deep, with eight bars (without frames).
The accompanying cut represents the super used with the bar and
frame hive.</p>

<p>Honey-combs in supers are better when made thicker than those
for breeding, consequently the bars are placed a little further apart
than in the lower or stock hive; they are either the "Woodbury
Ribbed," contrived to induce the straight building of combs, or flat
bars with guide combs affixed.</p>

<p id="Hive_Cover"><span class="smcap">Cover.</span>&mdash;A loose outer case, forming a complete cover for the hive,
is found very useful. The case is made in two parts for convenience,
the roof is also separate, having an acorn at top which forms a neat
finish. These outside cases are made of wood, and drop lightly over
all; when thus protected and fixed on a pedestal, the hive may be placed
in the open air in such position as fancy may dictate. The aspect
should be south or south-east, and if against a wall, sufficient space
must be allowed for a free passage behind, as it is from thence all
operations must be conducted by the apiarian. The case and roof
with the stand being the only parts exposed to weather, will be the
only portions that require painting; they are sometimes stained and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">- 42 -</span>
varnished, and we are inclined to
prefer the latter for appearance.
Should the apiarian have a complete
bee-hive house, the cover and
stands will not be needed.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page42" style="width: 213px;">
  <img src="images/page42.png" width="213" height="299" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When removing or replacing
the covers, care should be taken to
do so very gently, or the bees will
be enraged and rush out, and may
inflict stings upon those within their
reach. The necessity for lifting off
the cover for the purpose of looking
in, either at the window of the
stock hive or of the super, we have
obviated by making a door both
in the upper and lower parts of the outside case. These doors, or
unglazed windows, are hinged at the bottom so as to open downwards,
rendering inspection easy without disturbance to the bees.</p>

<p>A wooden range for supporting a number of hives makes a safe
and economical stand; it may be formed by driving firmly into the
ground two rows of posts, each row about 13 inches apart; to these
two rails about 2 inches square are nailed, and upon these the hives
firmly rest. Care should be taken not to have the hives nearer together
than 18 inches; the intermediate space will be found very convenient
on which to rest the cover, or for supporting an empty hive during
the proper performance of any operation.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury has his hives arranged on rails, somewhat after
the plan before described.</p>

<p>In describing as above the various hives and frames, some hints
have been given as to the methods of handling them. This, however,
will not suffice for an induction to the mysteries of practical
bee-keeping; and we must refer the reader to a subsequent section,
wherein the details as to manipulation will be fully explained, and
the results of the experience of several distinguished apiarians will
be embodied.</p>

No. 8. It is also similar in size, with
the exception of being quite straight at
the sides. A zinc rim affords protection
from the weather. Under
the upper straw hive a bell glass is
worked. A mahogany adapting board,
with a 4 inch hole in the centre corresponding
with that of the hive, supplies
an even surface for the glass to

<p>This is an ingenious contrivance of
Mr. Taylor's. Hoops are worked in the
straw, both at top and bottom of the stock
hive, and in the upper hoop are openings
cut to receive eight comb bars; each bar
is 1&frac14; of an inch wide, with a space of h an
inch between. Since the introduction of
square straw bar and frame hives, these
have not been much in request. Considerable
inconvenience is found with this

lengths they cannot be interchanged one
with the other.</p>

<p>This hive is well adapted
for those persons who are
desirous of having the opportunity
of closely examining
the workmanship of these
industrious and interesting
insects. It is particularly
intended for a window recess
or an indoor apiary; and will
also be found an interesting addition to the green house. An aperture
should be cut in the sash corresponding with the entrance to the
hive, through which the bees may find egress and ingress, without
being able to gain access to the apartment, as on the plan in the
case of the Ladies' Observatory Hive.</p>

<p>The Unicomb Hive is constructed of so narrow a width between
thin plates of glass that it admits of one comb only to be built, and at
the same time leaves space between the comb and the glass on either
side for the bees to pass and repass. It is thus made so that every
bee may be exposed to view. The queen forming the most prominent
feature of attention, she is readily distinguished by the greater
length of her body, as well as by the attention paid to her by the
other bees.</p>

<p>The mode of stocking this hive is as follows:&mdash;procure a strong
swarm if practicable, and let it be first hived into a common straw
hive in the usual way. Take care to make the necessary preparations
previous to the operation of stocking; for this purpose first unscrew
the top and take out the bar intended for the foundation of the
comb. A sort of wooden trough, contrived to act as a funnel, is
provided with this hive. It is in separate pieces, so as to be packed
conveniently, and requires screwing together. The funnel must now
be attached to the hive, and care be taken that it is quite firmly
fixed&mdash;the metal plates are attached for this purpose. Having
made these preparations at dusk, dash the bees out on to a cloth
or sheet spread on the ground, place four pieces of wood so as to
raise the hive a little from the cloth; then invert the hive so
as to have the funnel downwards, placing it over the bees, and
letting it rest on the four pieces of wood just named. In a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">- 45 -</span>
time (say half an hour or an hour) the bees will ascend into the
hive; they will go up more quickly if occasionally stirred with the
feather of a goose quill.</p>

<p>When the bees have ascended into the hive, take off the funnel,
replace the bar, screw on the top board, take it to the place intended
for it permanently to occupy, and which has been prepared for it.
It will be as well to screen the hive from view for a few days until the
bees become settled in their new domicile. Although this hive is constructed
of double glass to keep up a more uniform degree of warmth,
still from the cold nature of glass and the close contact into which
the bees are brought with it, it is advisable to place flannel between
the outer shutters and the glass of the hive on both sides; this is found
essential in winter, and very much adds to the comfort of the bees if
placed so every cold night during most of the year. In the day time
in summer months with the hive being of double glass the whole may be
fully exposed to view. If the temperature of the apartment in which
the hive stands be kept at 60 degrees, this extra attention will not
be so needful. Bees cease to appear disturbed when the exposure
to light is continuous. As soon as the bees are settled, comb
building will immediately commence, and in about two weeks'
time there will be one comb spreading over the whole hive. The
queen may be viewed depositing her eggs, and all the usual
operations of the rearing of brood, storing of honey, and the
building of combs, will be open to full inspection, with perfect ease
to the spectator. As an object of lively and permanent interest for the
breakfast parlour or conservatory, the "Unicomb Observatory Hive"
may be regarded as infinitely superior to an Aquarium or Fernery.</p>

<p>At the Exposition Universelle of 1855 in Paris, we exhibited a hive
of this description in full working order. The bees left London on the
5th of July of that year, and were placed in the Exposition on the
following morning. An entrance was made for them through the
side of the building, as before explained. Our bees had no national
antipathies, and they immediately sallied forth to their "fresh fields
and pastures new" in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, the gardens of the
Tuileries, the Luxembourg, &amp;c., whence they soon returned laden
with luscious store from French flowers.</p>

<p>The Jurors of the Exposition awarded us a Prize Medal for
bee-hives.</p>

<p id="Woodbury_Uni_Hive">WOODBURY UNICOMB HIVE.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page46" style="width: 354px;">
  <img src="images/page46.png" width="354" height="275" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The "Woodbury Unicomb Hive" has many advantages over
hives of this kind as previously constructed. The engraving shows
the interior compartment divided into six; these are six Woodbury
frames. The inner sash opens to admit of hanging up the frames
on the notches prepared for them. The width of the hive between
the glasses of the sashes is just sufficient to admit of one thickness
of comb with space on either side for the bees to pass and repass,
the same as in Neighbour's Unicomb. There is, however, a great
advantage in the use of this hive; with it, any one possessing a
Woodbury box or straw bar and frame hive can readily commence
a Unicomb, and as readily put the combs and bees back into the
square hive again. The outside shutters on either side are composed
of Venetian blinds admitting daylight, but obscuring the rays of
the sun. We had the entrance made at one end, as represented
in our drawing; this alteration was made after the pattern of
the hive from which Mr. Woodbury allowed us to copy. His own
was intended to stand wholly out of doors, and had two central
entrances, one on either side at the bottom, the hive itself turning
on a pivot.</p>

<p>When the hive was being examined on one side, the entrance
was closed by a piece of wood inserted in it, and when the other
side was brought round to be inspected, the piece of wood withdrawn
and placed in the opposite entrance. This was a most ingenious
contrivance; but it did not answer our purpose for indoors. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">- 47 -</span>
Mr. Woodbury sent us his hive, we were preparing for the
International Exhibition of 1862, and in placing it against the
sides of the building, we followed our old plan for ingress by
having the entrance at the end. Since that time we have made
a considerable improvement by adapting Mr. Woodbury's cleverly
contrived turn-table to suit our own hive. Like Mr. Woodbury's
hive, ours has two iron wheels, the one fixed to the bottom of the
hive, the other fixed to a stout board running the full length of the
hive; on these two wheels the whole hive turns. In the centre
there is an opening into the hive, with a passage-way running
underneath, so that the bees' entrance is in no way affected by the
position of the hive, which revolves to suit the convenience of
visitors inspecting it. Should the queen with her attendants not be
visible on one side, the other side of the comb can be brought into
full view, and examined with the same facility as a picture, or as
articles are inspected in a shop window. Thus, in the Unicomb
Observatory Hive, the sovereign mother, her train of servitors, the
drones with their aimless movements, and the crowd of ever busy
workers&mdash;either building their combs or storing honey&mdash;may be
always seen as presenting a veritable "Tableau vivant."</p>

<p>Another improvement that we have made upon Mr. Woodbury's
pattern is that of accommodating the frames; his was constructed
before frame hives were in use, consequently it is only suitable for
combs on bars. Our adaptation has necessitated an increase in
size. The dimensions are nearly 3 feet square and 7 inches deep
from back to front. Provision is made at top for feeding and for
working two small flat top glasses for deprivation, which are
protected by the weather board.</p>

<p>An alighting board is placed at the centre, close under the
entrance, when the hive is located out of doors. When the hive
is placed indoors, a passage-way about 18 inches long, covered with
glass, is fixed to the entrance, the other end communicating with
an opening in the wall or sash; through this the bees find access,
an alighting board being fixed outside the building. It is requisite
that the passage-way be about this length, in order to allow of the
hive turning round clear of the side of the building.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1863 we had ample proof of the success of
this hive during its exhibition at the annual show of the Bath and
West of England Agricultural Society at Exeter. We selected six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">- 48 -</span>
combs, and packed them in one of the square box "Woodbury
bar and frame" hives, and on arrival at Exeter, Mr. Woodbury
assisted us in taking out the frames and placing them in the
Unicomb. That being fixed against the boarded side of a shed,
we found the covered way a great convenience, and it answered
remarkably well; the bees did not seem to be inconvenienced by
having to travel through so long a passage. A glass covering admitted
a full view of the little labourers as they crowded in, and the
sight of them very much enhanced the interest of visitors examining
the hive.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> It may require explanation how it was that we took bees to Exeter, which
sounds something like "carrying coals to Newcastle." The reason was this&mdash;the
garden of our friend, Mr. Woodbury, at Mount Radford, from which we
could have been supplied, was so near to the show yard that he was apprehensive
a large number of the bees would return to their old hives. Our bees
from a distance would, according to their nature, return to their own hive, for
bees although they may be moved miles away, take care to mark their new
position, and are careful to return to it. Mr. Woodbury lent us a small stock
of his Ligurian bees, and between it and our own hive the crowd of visitors
divided their attention.</p>

</div>

<p>Since the time before mentioned, we have exhibited bees at the
meetings of the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society at
Bristol, and of the Royal Agricultural Society at Newcastle in 1864.
On both occasions further proof was given that this hive admirably
answers the purpose intended, and it afforded pleasure and interest
to many thousands of visitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of Stocking.</span>&mdash;The Unicomb hive may be stocked in
two ways, which have been previously referred to. The bee-keeper
may either select the comb upon which the queen is found and put
it into the hive, and so form an artificial swarm; or he may take
six brood-combs from a hive, and so stock the "Unicomb" at once,
which we did for the show at Exeter.</p>

<p>The former plan is, perhaps, the most advisable, because new
comb has to be built within the five frames; for, be it remembered,
in this case five empty frames must be put in. It is a better plan still
if artificial combs are placed in each frame so as to afford an interesting
opportunity of watching the formation of the cells therein. The
combs are sure to be dark in colour when taken from a stock hive;
and new combs being whiter have a better appearance in the hive.
The comb upon which the queen was introduced may be taken away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">- 49 -</span>
after the artificial swarm has made combs within some of the other
five frames; when the queen is on one of the new combs, opportunity
may easily be taken for opening the hive and removing the
old dark comb. The bees can easily be shaken or brushed off the
comb, and will return to the hive. The comb with the unhatched
brood may be deposited in any square hive that needs strengthening.
We mention this to show how to obtain a hive with entirely fine
white comb.</p>

<p>If the possessor of a square Woodbury frame-hive wishes to
start a strong Unicomb hive, and does not object to appropriate
the stock, he must take out of the Woodbury hive any six combs
on the frames, and put the Unicomb in its place so as to receive
all the returning bees that happen to be abroad; the remaining
four combs, supposing there are ten, may be inserted in any other
frame hives in the garden in which are vacancies for them.</p>

<p>We have had this hive in operation, in the manner last described,
during the summer of 1863, and found it to answer remarkably well.
On a lawn, placed on a suitable ornamental stand, it formed a
pleasing object, besides affording great interest and instruction.</p>

<p>In Unicomb hives stocked with a natural swarm (as is generally
the plan), there is considerable difficulty in keeping the bees alive
through the winter. In a hive where the combs are removeable, no
loss of bees need be occasioned. We do not recommend the hive
we are now describing as a winter residence for bees. For four
months in the year, when bees are most active and when their
operations are most interesting, this hive may be brought into use,
either of the two plans before described being adopted. An artificial
swarm should be put in during May or June, and taken out, in
the method before mentioned, and then placed in the square box
during the month of September; sometimes it may do for a stock
to be put in a month or so earlier, but should never be retained
later in this hive. In October we often have cold nights; the bees
and brood being in such close contact with the glass, and not able
to cluster as is their natural wont, suffer from exposure to the
variations of temperature. In some degree to moderate this. Me
have used treble glass with a space between each square; greater
warmth is thus attained, and the view is not intercepted. Opportunity
should be taken for cleaning the Unicomb hive when empty,
so as to be ready for re-stocking as a new hive in the following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">- 50 -</span>
summer. The "Unicomb Observatory" hive is one which might
have been suggested by the lines of Evans:&mdash;</p>

<p id="HUBERS_HIVE" class="caption3">HUBER'S HIVE. No. 19.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">Francis Huber</span>&mdash;not improperly styled the "Prince of
Apiarians,"&mdash;we are indebted for more extensive and accurate
observations on the habits of the Bee than has been contributed
by all other observers since the time of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>.</p>

<p>During the early period of Huber's investigations, he prosecuted
them by means of single comb hives which allow of each side of the
comb being examined. He found, however, that these had one
important defect. The bees could not in these hives cluster
together, which is their natural method of withstanding the effects
of a reduced temperature. Huber hit upon the ingenious expedient
of combining a number of single comb frames so as to form one
complete hive, which could be opened in order to expose any particular
comb, without disturbing the rest. From the manner of the
opening and closing of this hive, it has generally been called the
"Leaf or Book Hive." The division separating each comb is
joined both back and front with "butt hinges," fastened with a
moveable pin, on withdrawing which, at either side, each comb and
the bees on it may be inspected as easily as if in a single comb hive.
Huber's Leaf Hive is thus in appearance as if several of those
"History of England" back-gammon chess boards were set up on
end together. The floorboard on which the hive stands is larger
than the hive when closed, so as to allow of its being opened freely
at any particular "volume." An entrance way for the bees is
hollowed out of the floorboard as in other hives. There is a
glass window in each end of the hive, which is provided with a
shutter.</p>

<p>There is, however, one serious objection to Huber's hive, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">- 51 -</span>
though not noticed by him or his careful assistant, has prevented its
general use. That is, the difficulty there is in closing it without
crushing some of the bees, a catastrophe which, by exasperating
their comrades, is certain to interfere with any experiments. There
is no such risk in the Bar and Frame Hive, whilst in it every
facility possessed by Huber's is retained; so that we strongly
recommend scientific apiarians, in preference to Huber's, that they
should use some kind of Bar and Frame Hive. We have here
introduced a description of Huber's Leaf Hive (and should be glad
to exhibit one) for the sake of its historic interest in connection
with apiarian science. The invention was invaluable for Huber
himself, and it suggested to other apiarians the adoption of the
present plan of vertical bars and frames.</p>

<p>The character of Huber, and the circumstances under which he
pursued his observations, are so remarkable, that we need scarcely
apologize for stating a few particulars respecting him here. He
was born at Geneva in July, 1750, his family being in honourable
station and noted for talent. Just as he attained to manhood he
lost his sight, and remained blind to the end of his days. This
apparently insuperable obstacle in the way of scientific observation,
was overcome by the remarkable fidelity with which Burnens, his
assistant, watched the bees, and reported their movements to Huber,
Madame Huber also who, although betrothed to him before his
calamity, had remained constant in her affection, assisted in the
investigations with great assiduity during their long and happy
wedded life. We quote the following from "Memoirs of Huber,"
by Professor de Candolle:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have seen the blind shine as poets, and distinguish themselves
as philosophers, musicians, and calculators; but it was
reserved for Huber to give a lustre to his class in the sciences of
observation, and on objects so minute that the most clear-sighted
observer can scarcely perceive them. The reading of the works of
Reaumur and Bonnet, and the conversation of the latter, directed
his curiosity to the history of bees. His habitual residence in the
country inspired him with the desire, first of verifying some
facts, then of filling some blanks in their history; but this kind of
observation required not only the use of such an instrument as the
optician must furnish, but an intelligent assistant, who alone could
adjust it to its use. He had then a servant named Francis Burnens,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
remarkable for his sagacity and for the devotion he bore for his
master. Huber practiced him in the art of observation, directed
him to his researches by questions adroitly combined, and aided by
the recollections of his youth, and by the testimonies of his wife
and friends, he rectified the assertions of his assistant, and became
enabled to form in his own mind a true and perfect image of the
manifest facts. 'I am much more certain,' said he, smiling, to a
scientific friend, 'of what I state than you are, for you publish
what your own eyes only have seen, while I take the mean among
many witnesses.' This is, doubtless, very plausible reasoning, but
very few persons will by it be rendered distrustful of their own
eyesight."</p>

<p>The results of Huber's observations were published in 1792, in
the form of letters to Ch. Bonnet, under the title of "Nouvelles
Observation sur les Abeilles." This work made a strong impression
upon many naturalists, not only because of the novelty of the facts
stated, and the excellent inductive reasoning employed, but also on
account of the rigorous accuracy of the observations recorded, when
it was considered with what an extraordinary difficulty the author
had to struggle.</p>

<p>Huber retained the clear faculties of his observant mind until
his death, which took place on the 22nd of December, 1831. Most
of the facts relating to the impregnation of the queen, the formation
of cells, and the whole economy of the bee-community as discovered
and described by Huber, have received full confirmation from the
investigations of succeeding naturalists.</p>

<p>There is no contrivance
for protecting hives from
the weather so complete as
a bee-house one, which also
admits of an easy inspection
of the hives ranged
therein. This arrangement
is especially convenient for
lady bee-keepers.</p>

<p>The folding doors behind
the bee-house have
only to be opened, and the
hives are at once exposed to full view. If the cover of the bee-hive
be lifted as well as the shutters opened, the hives and the
glasses may be deliberately inspected, without any danger of
molestation from the bees. Thus the progress made by the busy
multitude in building and filling their combs may be watched by
the bee-keeper, from day to day with great and increasing interest.</p>

  <div class="figcaption"><p>Back View of the Interior.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here our engraving
shows the
back view of the
bee-house, the interior
being furnished
with two of
our 'No. 5 cottage
hives. Two suspended
weights
will be noticed;
these are to balance
the top hives
which cover the
glasses; the cord
for each, runs on pulleys, so that the covers can be easily raised and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">- 54 -</span>
easily shut down again when the inspection is finished. We may here
remark, that it is not well to keep the glasses long exposed to full
light and view.</p>

<p>The front of the bee-house being closely boarded, a passage way
is contrived for the bees by which they have egress and ingress,
without being able to gain access to the house. The hives must be
kept close to the front boarding of the house, so as to prevent
the opening of any crevices which the bees might mistake for the
entrance to their hives, and so find their way into the house. The
front view of this bee-house shows the ordinary contrivance for
entrance; the sliding zinc entrances may also be advantageously
fixed as shown in the engraving of a "Bee-house to contain twelve
hives." In many parts of the country, hives and honey are sometimes
stolen from the garden; the bee-houses we furnish have a
lock and key to prevent depredations of this kind.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to keep the bee-houses free from spiders
and other insects. In some districts ants are numerous and troublesome.
The plan we recommend for excluding them is to put some
pitch round the four supports of the bee-house; or, better still, strips
of loose flannel or other woollen material that is absorbent, which have
previously been soaked in lamp-oil. We use sperm oil, being the
slowest drying oil we know of. A piece of string will keep the flannel
close to the wood, and then neither ant or any other insect will
pass up; so that by this simple means the hives may, so to speak,
be insulated and placed beyond their reach. As the oil dries up it
can easily be renewed. We have found this an effectual remedy
against these insidious enemies of bees.</p>

<p>Where economy of room is a consideration, we fit up bee-houses
with a double row of hives, one above the other. Our engravings
show the back and front of a house of this kind, having an
ornamental zinc gutter to prevent the wet from dripping on to the
alighting board.</p>

<p>When a number of hives are thus together, we colour the
alighting boards differently, so that bees may have a distinctive
mark by which each may know its own home, and not wander
into its neighbour's house. Bees readily enough receive a honey
laden labourer into a hive; but if the wanderer be poor and empty,
he will be promptly repulsed, and may have to forfeit his life for
his mistake. Queens returning from their wedding trip, are liable
to mistake their hive if all the entrances are so much alike that a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span>
noticeable difference is not easily apparent. A queen entering a hive
already supplied with a fruitful sovereign would be certain to be
killed. The loss to the hive to which the queen belonged is a
most serious one. Hives are often made queenless from this cause,
and thereby reduced to utter ruin; the bee-master perhaps
attributing his loss to something altogether different.</p>

<p>This engraving represents
a bee-house adapted
for having a number of
hives in a limited space.
Three rows of hives, one
above the other.</p>

<p>We do not recommend
a bee-house of this construction;
it is difficult to
erect one to afford space
for super hives, without it
being so inconveniently high as to be liable to be blown over by
strong winds.</p>

<p>Hives thus located in a bee-house are not exposed to so much
change of temperature and the stocks generally pass the winter well.
Here we may introduce the meditations of a German apiarian,
as he describes the advantages of a bee-house for the bees, and his
own pleasure in watching over his pets in the winter, as they dwell
so comfortably and safely. It is true that Heer Braun associates
still choicer delights with the simple pleasures of bee-keeping, but
as Mr. Woodbury has not excluded the higher theme from his
translation, we need not hesitate to quote the whole:&mdash;</p>

has a 3 inch hole in the centre, the purpose of which is
to tempt bees to produce additional and larger stores
of honey. It is to be used as follows:&mdash;when a bell
glass is half or quite filled, raise it, and place the
Payne's glass over the hole of the stock hive, with the filled glass
on it over the 3 inch hole. The bees will bring their combs
through, and thus Mr. Payne found that they would store more
honey than if the bell glass were removed and another empty one
put in its place. Of course the first glass must be smaller in
diameter than the Payne's glass, so as to rest upon it.</p>

<p>This is a glass super to be placed on the hive in
a similar way to the bell glasses already alluded to.
It has the advantages of being straight at the sides,
flat at top, and without a knob; so that when filled
it may be brought on to the breakfast table, inverted,
on a plate. The glass lid shown in the engraving
forms a cover, and fits over outside, so as not to interfere with the
combs within. These flat top glasses, like those with a knob, have
a hole through which a zinc ventilating tube is inserted.</p>


<p id="GUIDE_COMB_FOR_GLASSES" class="caption3">GUIDE COMB FOR GLASSES.</p>

<p>In some of our previous allusions to the best mode of inducing
bees to commence working in glasses, we have recommended
attaching guide comb. We will now more particularly explain
how this attraction can be best applied. We have already shown
how bees may be induced to make use of guide combs fixed to bars,
and the same principle is applicable to glasses. These may be
filled with great regularity by adopting the following directions,
which we believe have never before appeared in print:&mdash;</p>

<p>Procure a piece of clean new empty worker honey-comb
which has not had honey in it (because honey will prevent
adhesion to the glass); cut it up into pieces of about three
quarters of an inch square. Gently warm the exterior of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span>
glass; this we find is best done by holding the glass horizontally for a short
time over the flame of a candle; then apply one of the pieces
of empty comb inside at the part warmed, taking care in fixing
it that the pitch or inclination of the cells is upwards&mdash;in fact, place
the guide comb in the same relative position that it occupied in the
hive or glass from which it was taken. There is some danger of
making the glass too warm, which will cause the comb to melt, and
the wax to run down the side, leaving an unsightly appearance on
the glass; this should be carefully avoided, and a little experience
will soon enable the operator to determine the degree of warmth
sufficient to make the comb adhere without any of it being melted.
It is hardly necessary to state that only the very whitest combs
ought to be used. A short time should be allowed before changing
the position of the glass, so that it may cool sufficiently to hold the
comb in its place. Six or eight pieces may thus be fixed, so that
when the glass is filled, it will present a star shape, all
the combs radiating from the centre. The annexed
engraving shows the appearance of a glass as worked
by the bees, in which guide combs were fixed in the
manner described above. The drawing was taken from
a glass of our own filled after being thus furnished.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page62" style="width: 82px;">
  <img src="images/page62.png" width="82" height="90" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the Old Museum at the Royal Gardens, Kew, may be seen
a Taylor's glass presented by us, some of the combs in which are
elongated on the outside to the breadth of six inches. We believe
that not only does a glass present a much handsomer appearance
when thus worked&mdash;and will, on that account, most fully reward
the trouble of fixing guide comb&mdash;but that more honey is stored in
the same space and in less time than if the glass be placed on the
hive merely in a naked condition for the bees to follow their own
devices.</p>

<p>This mode of fixing guide comb does not solely apply to this
shaped glass, but is equally useful for all kinds of glasses. It is
introduced in connection with No. 28, because that glass having a
flat top and no knob, the regularity is more clearly apparent.</p>

<p>The working of bees in the bell glasses illustrates how tractable
their disposition really is if only scope be allowed for the due
exercise of their natural instinct. They have no secrets in their
economy, and they do not shrink from our constant observation as
they daily pursue their simple policy of continuous thrift and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">- 63 -</span>
persevering accumulation. Yet it is only owing to the labours of
successive inventors that we are now enabled to watch "the very
pulse of the machine" of the bee-commonwealth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page63" style="width: 60px;">
  <img src="images/page63.png" width="60" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It has long been acknowledged that the best mode of
feeding bees is through an opening at the top of the stock
hive. The "new bottle feeder" is a simple and good means
of administering food when a stock requires help in that
way. Any kind of hive that has an opening at the top may
thus be fed; bees can take the food from it without leaving the hive.
Another important feature is the cleanliness with which liberal feeding
can be accomplished; and few operations require more care than does
feeding. If liquid sweet is left hanging about the hive, it tempts
robber bees, and when once the bees of an apiary have had a taste,
there is no knowing where their depredations will stop; they
resolutely attack and endeavour to rob other hives, fighting and
killing one another to a considerable extent. Even if no hives be
completely destroyed, weakness from loss of numbers will be the
portion of most, if not all, the hives in the garden.</p>

<p>The morals of our favorites are here a good deal at fault, for the
strongest hives, when their inordinate passion is thus stirred up by
the carelessness or want of knowledge of the bee-keeper, attack and
prey upon the weak. To be "forewarned is to be forearmed"&mdash;and
"prevention is better than cure." We strongly recommend
closely covering up the feeder; one of the middle size bell glasses
put over it makes a close fitting cover, should the regular cover to
the hive not be sufficiently tight: when bees are not kept in a
bee-house&mdash;and are on that account more accessible&mdash;this extra care is
more particularly needed. The right time for feeding is in the
autumn or spring. A stock of bees at Michaelmas ought to weigh
20 lbs. exclusive of the hive, and if then it weigh less, the deficiency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
should be made up by artificial food. It is not wise to defer doing
this until later in the season, because it is important that when the
food is placed in the cells, the bees should seal it up, and a tolerably
warm temperature is required to enable them to secrete the wax for
the delicately formed lids of the cells. If the food remain unsealed,
there is danger of its turning sour and thereby causing disease
among the bees. It is not well to feed in mid-winter or when the
weather is very cold. Bees at such times consume but little food,
being in a state of torpor, from which it is better not to arouse them.</p>

<p>A little food in the spring stimulates the queen to lay more
abundantly, for bees are provident, and do not rear the young so
rapidly when the supplies are short. In this particular the intelligence
of bees is very striking; they have needed no Malthus to
teach them that the means of subsistence must regulate the increase
of a prosperous population:</p>

<p>[** no indent]Judgment has, however, to be exercised by the apiarian in giving
food, for it is quite possible to do <i>mischief by over feeding</i>. The
bees when over-fed will fill so many of the combs with honey that
the queen in the early spring cannot find empty cells in which to
deposit her eggs, and by this means the progress of the hive is much
retarded, a result that should be guarded against.</p>

<p>The following directions will show how the bottle feeder is to
be used:&mdash;Fill the bottle with liquid food, place the net fixed on
with an India-rubber band over the mouth, place the block over the
hole of the stock hive, invert the bottle, the neck resting within the
hole in the block; the bees will put their proboscises through the
perforations and imbibe the food, thus causing the bottle to act on
the principle of a fountain. The bottle being glass, it is easy to
see when the food is consumed. The piece of perforated zinc is
for the purpose of preventing the bees from clinging to the net,
or escaping from the hive when the bottle is taken away for the
purpose of refilling. A very good syrup for bees may be made by
boiling 6 lbs. of honey with 2 lbs. of water for a few minutes; or
loaf sugar, in the proportion of 3 lbs. to 2 lbs. of water, answers
very well when honey is not to be obtained.</p>

<p>Round bee-feeders are made of zinc and
earthenware; 8 inches across, 3 inches deep.
The projection outside is a receptacle for
pouring in the food; the bees gain access to
the feeder through a round hole, which is placed either at the centre
or nearer one side, whichever may best suit the openings on the top
of the stock hive. The feeder occupies a similar position to that of
the glasses or cap hives in the gathering season. A circular piece
of glass, cut so as to fit into a groove, prevents the bees escaping
and retains the warmth within the hive, whilst it affords opportunity
for inspecting the bees whilst feeding.</p>

<p>The feeders were originally only made of zinc; but some bee-keepers
advised the use of earthenware, and a few have been made
to meet the wishes of those who give the preference to that material.</p>

<p>When the bees are fed from above in this manner, the feeder is
kept at a warm temperature by the heat of the hive. In common
hives cottagers feed the bees by pushing under the hive thin slips
of wood scooped out, into which the food is poured. This plan of
feeding can only be had recourse to at night, and the pieces of wood
must be removed in the morning. By feeding at the top of the
stock hive any interruption of the bees is avoided. For further
instructions on this head see the directions given for using the
bottle feeder.</p>

<p>We invented the fountain bee-feeder so that a
larger supply of liquid food might be given to a hive
than is practicable with the No. 10 round feeder.</p>

<p>The liquid honey is poured in at the
opening, which unscrews; whilst being filled, the
inside slide closing the opening through which the food passes into
the feeding pan, should be shut down. When the reservoir is
filled, the screw is made fast, and the slide being withdrawn, a
wooden float pierced with small holes, through which the bees take
the food, forms a false bottom, and rises and falls with the liquid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">- 66 -</span>
This feeder being on the syphon principle, like a poultry or bird
water-fountain, is supplied from the reservoir until that is empty. A
piece of glass is fixed in the side of the reservoir, in order that the
bee-keeper may see when it is emptied. A flat piece of glass on the
top prevents the bees from escaping, and through it they may be
inspected whilst feeding. The bees find access to the feeder on
to the perforated float through the central round hole, which is
placed over a corresponding hole in the stock hive.</p>

<p>This Fumigator is a tin box, somewhat like a pepper
box upon a foot. It is a simple adaptation of the fumigating
apparatus described by Mr. Nutt, and is used in
the following manner. Have a straw hive or other vessel
ready, that will match in circumference the hive intended
to be fumigated. If the empty hive have a conical top, it will not
remain crown downwards without a rest; in this case, it will be
convenient to invert it on a pail. Having ascertained that the hive to
be operated upon and the empty one in its reversed position nearly
match in size, take half a packet of the prepared fungus, fire
it well, and place it in the box or fumigator; placing this in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">- 67 -</span>
centre of the empty hive, then bring the occupied hive directly over,
so as to receive the fumes of smoke. To keep all close, put a wet
cloth round the place where the two hives meet. In a minute or two
the bees may be heard dropping heavily into the lower empty hive,
where they lie stupefied. After a little while, the old hive may be tapped
upon to make the bees fall more quickly. On removing the upper
hive, the bees from it will be found lying quiet at the bottom of the
lower one. Place a sheet on the ground, and spread the bees on it,
then with a feather sort them over, in order to pick out the queen-bee.
As soon as the queen is found, then pour the rest of the lethargic
swarm from off the sheet back into the inverted hive again.
The stupefied bees must now be sprinkled freely with a syrup made
of honey and water, or sugar and ale boiled together. Some
apiarians recommend a few drops of peppermint to be mixed with
the syrup, in order to drown the peculiar odour which is special to
each hive of bees,&mdash;this is more necessary when two hives of bees are
fumigated and whilst under the influence of smoke are well mixed
together. The hive containing the bees with which it is intended
to unite the stupefied bees, must now be placed on the top of that
containing the latter, just as the hive was from which they have come.
A wet cloth must be fastened round the two hives, so as to prevent
any of the bees from escaping. The hives in this position must be
placed where they are not likely to be knocked down or meddled
with. The fresh bees in the upper hive, attracted by the scent of the
bees besmeared with honey, go down and commence to lick off the
sweets from the sprinkled sleepy ones. The latter gradually revive,
when all get mingled together, and ascend in company to the upper
hive, where they live as if they had not been separate families.</p>

<p>The two hives should be left undisturbed for twenty-four hours,
then the upper hive may be removed and placed immediately on
the spot from whence it was brought. The reason the queen is
recommended to be taken is to prevent any fighting.</p>

<p>The queen should be kept alive and fed as long as she will
live, in case any harm should befall the sovereign of the other
community.</p>

<p>The Fumigator is useful for several purposes.
When a frame hive has to be disturbed it is
requisite to raise the lid and blow a little smoke
into the hive, so as to check the angry passions of the bees.
If it be desirable to stupefy the bees, ignited fungus must be
placed in the box, and the flattened end applied to the entrance of
the hive; the smoke is then blown in&mdash;either with bellows or by
applying the mouth of the operator,&mdash;taking care to close all
openings through which the smoke can escape. The bees fall
down stupefied, generally in about ten minutes, but the effect varies
according to the populousness of the hive and the quantity of comb
in it. The projected operations must now be performed speedily,
as activity will soon be regained. See preceding directions.</p>

</div>

<p>All operations connected with the removal or the
hiving of bees should be conducted with calmness
and circumspection. Bees, although the busiest of
creatures, have great dislike to fussiness in their
masters, and become irritable at once if the apiarian
lets them see that he is in a hurry. Hence, there
is great advantage in having the face and hands
covered whilst at work amongst the bees; for when
the operator knows he cannot possibly be stung, he
can then open his hives, take out the combs, gather
in his swarms, or take the honey, with all the deliberation of a
philosopher. Various kinds of bee dresses have been contrived;
one that we keep ready in stock is of very simple construction. It
is made of strong <i>black net</i>, in shape like an inverted bag, large
enough to allow of a gentleman's wide-awake or a lady's hat being
worn underneath. The projection of the hat or cap causes the
dress to stand off from the face; and the meshes of the net, though
much too small for a bee to penetrate, are wide enough to allow of
clear vision for the operator. An elastic band secures the dress
round the waist; the sleeves also&mdash;made of durable black calico&mdash;are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">- 69 -</span>
secured at the wrists by a similar method. The hands of the
bee-master may be effectually protected with a pair of India-rubber
gloves, which should be put on before the dress is fastened round
the wrists. This kind of glove is regularly used by photographers,
and allows of perfect ease in manipulation.</p>

<p>Thus a very simple and inexpensive means of protection will
enable even a novice in bee-keeping to make his observations and
conduct his experiments under a sense of perfect security. Still he
need not be careless as to the feelings of his bees; his success and
their comfort will be promoted by his "handling them gently, and
as if he loved them." "Familiarity" between bees and their
master "breed" not "contempt," but affection.</p>

<p>Any sudden or clumsy movement which jars the combs or
frames will excite the bees, and if but one should be crushed, the
odour of their slaughtered comrade rouses them to a pitch of
exasperation. Their powers of smell are very acute. The best
time for most operations is in the middle of a fine day.</p>

<p>This is an engraved metal
roller, which when applied to
the coated underside of a comb-bar
leaves an impression like the
diagram shown. The wax having
been spread on the flat bar, the
roller, heated by being put into
hot water, is then heavily pressed
over it. The roller has two wood
handles, so that considerable pressure may be given to it. The
roller is a little less than 2 inches in diameter, &#8542; of an inch wide,
and the length from handle to handle is 6 inches. The diagram
shows the full size of the impressions as left on the wax after
passing the roller along the comb bar in the manner above
described. It is a contrivance invented in Switzerland, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span>
exhibited in the International Exhibition of 1862, when the
pattern roller was purchased by ourselves.</p>

<p>The bars of a hive prepared with these markings in wax afford
ready made foundations for regular combs, which very much
facilitate the operations of the bees.</p>


<p id="IMPRESSED_WAX_SHEETS" class="caption3">IMPRESSED WAX SHEETS FOR ARTIFICIAL COMB.</p>

<p>These artificial partition walls for combs are sheets of genuine
wax, about the substance of thin cardboard. They receive
rhomboidal impressions by being pressed between two metal
plates, carefully and mathematically prepared and cast so that
the impressions are exactly the same size as the base of the cells of
a honey-comb. An inspection of a piece of comb will show that
the division of the opposite cells is made by a thin partition wall
common to both; now the substance of this is said to be only the
one hundred and eightieth part of an inch, whilst the artificial ones
we are recommending are between the thirtieth and fortieth part of
an inch, more than four times the thickness of the handy-work of the
bees themselves. It would, indeed, be vain to attempt to furnish
sheets of wax at all approaching their own delicate fabric; the
impressed sheets are quite as thin as they can be to bear the
handling which is requisite for fixing them in the hives. We
find, however, that the thickness is no disadvantage; the bees
speedily excavate and <i>pare the artificial sheet</i> so as to suit their
<i>own</i> notions of the substance required; then, with admirable
economy, they use the surplus thus obtained for the construction of
the cells. After a sheet has been partly worked at by the bees,
it is interesting to hold it up to the light and observe the beautiful
transparency of that part of it contrasted with the opaqueness of
the part not yet laboured upon.</p>

<p>When it is considered, as writers tell us, that more than fourteen
pounds of honey are required for the secretion and elaboration of
a single pound of comb, it will not be difficult to form a just estimate
of the value of this invention, which thus furnishes cheap and excellent
assistance to our industrious favorites. It also shows the bee-keeper
that all clean empty combs should be carefully preserved,
and considered as valuable stock. Another great advantage that it
affords us is, that it renders us independent of <i>guide comb</i>, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span>
not always obtainable. When a sheet or a strip of this impressed
wax is properly fixed to the comb bar, it is <i>certain</i> to be the guide
and foundation of a straight comb. This invention has been derived
from Germany, where it has been adopted many years with success.
At the International Exhibition of 1862, we purchased the metal
plates or castings, so as to manufacture the impressed sheets with
which we are now able to supply our customers; and, after the
careful trials we have made, we have great confidence in recommending
them.</p>

<p>In the season of 1863 we furnished a Woodbury glass super
with the wax sheets fixed to the bars, in the manner hereafter to
be explained, and it was truly astonishing to see the rapidity with
which these sheets of wax were worked into comb. Receptacles were
quickly made ready for the storing of honey, and the new combs soon
became beautifully white; for although the artificial wax has a yellow
tinge, yet after being worked at and made thinner, it is as good in
colour as ordinary combs. For supers we cut the wax plates in half,
making one serve for two bars.</p>

<p>We have received from Germany the following directions for the
fastening of the artificial plates to the comb bars. Hereafter will
be described a plan which we have adopted, and to which preference
is given.</p>

<p>(Translation) "The unstamped edge of the plate receives incisions
half an inch distant from one another made with a sharp knife, the
plate having been a little warmed. Then it is pinched between two
equally strong ledges which have been well moistened; the projecting
edge of the plate which received the incisions is alternately bent to
the right and to the left. The comb bars are well besmeared with
artificial sticking wax (a mixture of two parts of wax and one part
of American resin), and is well warmed at a fire. Afterwards the
besmeared side is laid upon the bent end of the plate, and pressed
to it as firmly as possible. A small wooden ledge, besmeared with
sticking wax and fastened by means of pressure to the lower edge of
the plate, prevents it from bending, which sometimes happens when
the bees work it."</p>

<p>To carry out the directions here given, it is necessary to warm
the besmeared comb-bar at a fire; the wax plate has also to be
warmed. Having tried this plan, and found inconvenience attending
it, especially from the wax curling with the heat and the difficulty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
of making it stick firm,&mdash;to say nothing of the uncomfortableness
of performing the operation before a fire on a hot day in July,&mdash;we
began to consider if a little carpentering might not do the work
better and more pleasantly, and adopted the following plan:&mdash;We
split or cut the comb bars of the Woodbury super in
half lengthways, and taking the unstamped edge between the two
strips, join them together again by small screws at the side,
confining the wax plate tightly in the centre, with no possibility of
its falling down. Where frames are used, of course, the bar could
not be cut in two (except with the "compound bar and frame,"
where the bar being loose, it might be as easily managed). The
plan we adopt with an ordinary frame is to saw out an opening
about an inch, or an inch and a half from either end where the
sides are morticed in; this opening we make with a keyhole saw.
Through it the wax plate is easily put, and with a heated iron
passed over the upper side of the bar, is made sufficiently firm.
If the wax plates are too large, a portion may easily be cut off; an
opening of full 11 inches long can be made without materially
weakening the bar and frame.</p>

<p>The wax plates must not extend to the bottom of the frame; a
space of at least one inch should be left for expansion, because the
bees in working the plate stretch it down lower. We also use a few
pins firmly pressed into the frames, and long enough to reach the
edge of the plate, for by fixing three or four pins on either side,
both at the sides and at the bottom, the plate may be held in an
exactly central position within the frame. As before mentioned,
when these directions are carried out, there is no fear of being
troubled with crooked combs on bars.</p>

<p>The secretion of wax, and the method of its adaptation by the
bees, is thus admirably described by Evans:&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV_MANIPULATION_AND_USES_OF_BAR_AND_FRAME_HIVES">IV. MANIPULATION AND USES OF BAR AND FRAME HIVES.</h2>
</div>


<p>Having at <a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>, given a description of the mechanical
arrangements of bar and frame hives, the next thing is to
describe the mode of introducing the bees, and of thus bringing
the humane and scientific hives into operation. The swarm
should be first hived into a common straw hive from the bough
or shrub upon which they may have alighted; place this hive,&mdash;into
which we will suppose the bees have been shaken,&mdash;on the
ground, propped up on one side with a brick or a flower pot, or
anything of the sort that may be handy, in order that straggler bees
may join the swarm. The spot selected for this should be as shady
an one as can be found, near to the place where the swarm settled;
or it may be shaded from the rays of the sun by fixing matting on
two poles so as to prevent the heat falling on the hive; spread a
sheet or cloth on the ground where an even surface can be obtained;
stake this sheet down at the four corners, to prevent ruts and
inequalities, which are great hindrances to the bees going into the
bar and frame hive; place the latter upon the sheet without its
floorboard, having its front raised on blocks or sticks rather more
than an inch,&mdash;not more, otherwise the bees will cluster and attach
themselves to the lower part of the frames instead of going up
between. These preparations will perhaps occupy ten minutes, by
which time the swarm will have become settled and tolerably quiet.
Then with a sharp rap precipitate the bees out of the straw hive
on to the sheet immediately in front of the frame hive; give the
straw hive another knock so as to dislodge all the bees, and then
take it quite away, otherwise they may, if it be left near, perversely
choose to go into that instead of the one desired. In some cases, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">- 74 -</span>
when the swarm has to be brought from a distance, and procured from
a cottager about whose skill in carrying out these directions there may
be misgivings, it is best to give instructions that the swarm be brought
home after sunset, and then the foregoing directions for inducing
the bees to tenant the frame-hive may be better carried out; for ourselves,
we much prefer the evening for the purpose. A little water
sprinkled over them from a watering pot is likely to induce the bees
to quit the ground and go up into the hive more quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. Langstroth, in his admirable book "The Hive and Honey
Bee," writes "If they are too dilatory in entering the new hive, they
may be gently separated with a spoon or leafy twig, where they
gather in bunches on the sheets or they may be carefully 'spooned
up' and shaken out close to the front of the hive. As these go
in with fanning wings, they will raise a peculiar note, which communicates
to their companions that they have found a home, and in
a short time the whole swarm will enter, without injury to a single
bee." In the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>, Mr. Woodbury says "If
combs be fixed in the frames, the crown board may be removed, and
the cluster knocked out of the straw hive on to the top of the
exposed frames. The bees will disappear between them with the
utmost alacrity, delighted to have met with a ready furnished
dwelling, and the top or crown board having been replaced, the
hive should at once be removed to the position it is intended
permanently to occupy."</p>

<p>No one should attempt these operations without being protected
by a <i>bee dress</i>, and a pair of India-rubber gloves,&mdash;such as those used
by photographers,&mdash;which are sting proof. Some persons also take the
precaution of tying strings round the ankles of the trowsers, lest some
straggler should determine to attack the outposts of the enemy, which,
to say the least, might perplex the operator in the midst of his task.
Elastic India-rubber bands are good for this purpose, or a pair of
"knickerbockers" would be useful. If Wellington boots are worn,
the trowsers may be tucked within the leather, in which case no bee
can molest the operator, and no string or band will be needed.
Practice makes perfect in bee tending as in other matters, and when
a light hand is gained, there is little danger of the apiarian being
stung.</p>

<p>If the weather be wet the next day or so after hiving, it will be
well to give a little assistance to the new colony in the shape of food,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">- 75 -</span>
for although when a swarm leaves a hive almost every bee composing
it fills itself with honey, we have known not a few instances in case of
very wet weather, in which the whole swarm has been starved for
the want of this little timely help. Of course, the first work of the
bees is to build themselves combs, and these combs being produced
by the secretion of wax from honey, a great drain upon their resources
immediately begins, and any little outlay at this juncture is abundantly
compensated by its enabling these industrious emigrants the more
quickly to push, forward the furnishing of their new home. Clean
combs from hives that may have lost their bees are readily accepted,
and cause a great saving in time and material to the bees; these
combs may easily be fixed by cutting them the proper size to fit
within the frames, and making them firm by tying with tape or
fixing them with pliable wire. Artificial comb (see <a href="#Page_70">page 70</a>) is often
used, and has this advantage, that the combs are certain to be
straight and regular, besides the saving in material to the bees.</p>

<p>These preparations must be made prior to the bees being hived,
so that when a hive is so prepared, a swarm may begin to adapt
whatever advantages they find ready for them; and it is truly
marvellous what a swarm will do when thus furnished with combs in
their new habitation. In these the queen can immediately begin to
deposit her eggs, and the workers to store their honey, without
having to wait for the construction of combs, which is a laborious
occupation for the bees.</p>

<p>In some cases, fine white combs may be taken from the stock
hive; the end frames are always the most free from brood. Care
must be exercised not to rob this part of the hive too much; one
comb may perhaps be removed in the course of the season without
impoverishing the bees, but it is not wise to take more.</p>

more is called a "stock," by way of distinction from a swarm of the
present year. Supposing the hive to be a stock, the super should be
given them at the early part of the season, say, if fine and warm, at
the latter end of April or beginning of May; if the weather be then
unfavourable, it is better to delay doing so until a more genial
temperature. If the colony be a swarm of the present year, two
weeks should be allowed to elapse from the time of tenanting a hive,
before putting on the super; this delay is necessary to give the bees
the opportunity of building combs in their new domicile, and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">- 76 -</span>
getting a store of honey for themselves before working for their
master.</p>

<p>When it is wished to use a super, the crown board or roof of
the stock hive must be taken away, the thin adapting or honey
board taking its place; the two long slits at the sides are to give
admission to the super. The bees will begin sooner and work
faster if the eight bars are each furnished with artificial comb (as
described <a href="#Page_71">page 71</a>). We have had depriving hives very quickly
filled when the bees were thus assisted. Combs that have been left
unfilled may be fixed to the bars as before described; these must be
white and clean, as dark comb should not be used for super hives.
The combs when filled may be taken out singly, if desired for
consumption, substituting an empty bar or comb; or should the
bee-keeper desire to see a handsome super, he must wait until the
bees have filled and sealed up all the combs, and then he may
proceed to deprive them of it as before described.</p>

<p id="Taking_Out"><span class="smcap">Taking out Frames with Combs.</span>&mdash;It is well for a beginner to
practice the directions for opening and shutting up hives by using an
empty hive, until he becomes familiar with the handling of the frames.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to loosen the crown board or lid with a
knife, drawing a piece of string underneath it to divide the wax or
cement with which the bees make all secure. This string should
be drawn through very slowly, so as not to irritate the bees.
In hot weather, the crown board may be loosened by a lateral
movement; but sometimes, for want of care, this loosening of the
lid disturbs the bees, and as soon as it is removed, a number of
them, enraged thereby, pour out and attack the operator. This and
all other operations ought be done very carefully and gently;
especial care should be taken not to prise the lid upwards, by way
of wrenching it off, for the frames and combs are generally secured
thereto, and there is a liability of rending the combs with it; this
will greatly irritate the bees, and be otherwise injurious. When a
hive of bees is enraged, there is little chance of pacifying them; it
is best, under such circumstances to 'give in' at once, and not
attempt to perform any operation, but to shut the hive up and beat
a retreat, benefiting by the experience so as to do better in a day
or so afterwards. There are various devices for intimidating or
conciliating the bees, and one of these already spoken of is&mdash;smoke.
So next time the experimenter makes his attempt let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">- 77 -</span>
bill! raise the lid an inch or so, and blow a few puffs of smoke
into the hive, which will cause the bees to retreat. This
is best done by using our No. 12 fumigator, with a little of the
prepared fungus lighted. Pipes or cigars are not convenient to use
for this purpose when the head is enveloped in the dress. As soon
as the lid is removed, a few bees will fly out to learn the cause of
such an interference. Conciliation should then be introduced by
having at hand a little sweetened water, which may be sprinkled,
or rather let drop from a feather or brush. The sudden motion of
the hand required in the act of sprinkling irritates the bees, so that
instead of making them our friends, they may become our foes.
Mr. Langstroth recommends that a fine watering pot filled with
sweetened water, be used for the purpose. Care must be taken not
to drench the bees; only just sufficient should be given to run down
the sides of the combs as well as sprinkling the top. As soon as
the bees really understand that syrup is being given them, they
feast upon it instead of angrily attacking the operator. Thus
pacified, and with gentle treatment, but little difficulty will be
found in proceeding with the work required. But the unskilled
operator should on no account neglect to put on a bee-dress and
gloves as described above. We would err on the side of caution,
although there is an old saying that "a cat in gloves catches no
mice," and the apiarian will find that his fingers are not so free to
work as he would like, for gloves make them rather clumsy in
drawing up the frames.</p>

<p>The frames must now be gently prised from front to rear; this may
be done with a small screw-driver or other stout instrument with a
wedged end to go into the notches. The frames fit loosely so as to
allow of a little movement from back to front; a lateral or side-way
movement might kill the queen; or if not so fatal as that, might crush
some of the bees and injure the brood combs, and must be carefully
avoided. It, of course, depends upon what the operation is that has
to be performed whether or no all the frames should be thus loosened.
If it be for making artificial swarms, or for any purpose requiring an
interview with her majesty, the whole of them must be loosened,
because it often happens that all the combs have to be examined,
sometimes twice over, before she can be discovered. Bees are very
apt to build their combs in a slightly waving form, and in extracting
one it will be needful to make room both for the comb and bees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">- 78 -</span>
upon it to pass without scraping the next comb, and there will be
a difficulty if the apiarian attempts to draw out one comb whilst the
other frames are located in their appropriate notches. Let the
operator gently proceed to lift say the third frame (allowing it to
lodge on the little block that divides the notches) a little nearer to
the fourth frame, and the second nearer the third, so as to admit of
sufficient space to lift out the end one. Very carefully and slowly
he should lift the frame by taking hold with thumb and finger of
the projecting shoulders that rest in the notch; and he must not let
it touch or scrape the next frame or the sides of the hive so as to
crush or irritate any bees.</p>

<p>After the end comb is thus removed, it will be easy to extract
the others, as there will now be plenty of room for drawing them out.
A hive of exactly the same size should be at hand; and in case it be
desired to remove the combs and bees into another hive, care should
be taken that each comb occupies the same relative position that it
did in the old hive.</p>

<p>In handling the frames, bear in mind that they are to be held
perpendicularly. To gain a view of both sides of the comb when
searching for the queen, or for any purpose requiring full inspection,
with a little dexterity in twirling the frame round, the reverse side may
be brought to face the operator, without letting the comb break away
by its own weight and so fall out of the frame, which it will do if
allowed to deviate from its upright or downright position. If the
operator could see an experienced person perform the operation, he
would quickly understand how combs may thus be handled without
any risk of a smash.</p>

<p>When placing frames in the hive, care must be taken not to
crush a bee between the projecting shoulders of the frame and the
rabbets or notches on which they rest, and on no account must the
frame be let down with a jerk, or the bees will become exceedingly
fierce: the frame should be so slowly deposited in its place that a
bee on feeling the slightest pressure may have the opportunity of
escaping unhurt thereby. The crown board should be replaced by
first resting its front edge in its place, and then slowly lowering the
after part, looking carefully under, and momentarily raising it when
necessary to avoid crushing a bee. Should the hive have its super
on, the same directions may be followed. The super with its honey
board may be bodily taken away, and so placed and confined for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">- 79 -</span>
time that robber bees cannot find an entrance, and also be far
enough from the apiarian to be out of danger of being broken or
overturned by him.</p>

<p id="Adv_Bar_Frame"><span class="smcap">Advantages of Bar and Frame Hives.</span>&mdash;It will be asked
why all this trouble about bar and frames with straight combs built
upon them? We have shown the full command which the bee-keeper
has over a hive so constituted, and we now proceed to show
how in skilful hands these advantages may be used successfully;
though, in the hands of the unpractised and unskilful the contrary
may be the result.</p>

<p>All the bars and frames in an apiary ought to be of precisely the
same dimensions, so as to fit every hive. This is essential for the
strengthening of weak hives. A hive that is weakly may often be
advantageously strengthened by having put into it a comb of
brood from a populous stock, to which an empty frame from
the weak one may be given; no bees must be on the brood-comb&mdash;these
should be shaken off or gently dislodged with a
feather into the hive from which the comb is taken. The frames
of the hive from which the comb has been taken, should be, one
by one, placed so as to fill in the vacancy, leaving the empty frame
nearest the side. When a hive has been in use many years, the
combs become very black, and every bee that is bred in a cell leaves
a film behind. It may be understood how in this way the cells
become contracted, so that the bees that are bred in them are
correspondingly reduced in size. After the lapse of say five years, it
may be necessary to begin to remove the old combs. This may be
done by cutting away the comb or by substituting an empty frame
for one with old black comb, gradually moving the frames towards
each other. By taking two away in this manner in the spring or
summer of every season, the combs in course of five years may all
be reconstructed and fresh clean ones be secured for breeding in,
instead of the old black ones that otherwise would remain as long as
the stock could live in the hive.</p>

<p id="art_swarming"><span class="smcap">Artificial Swarming.</span>&mdash;Every bee-keeper knows the anxiety
there is in watching and expecting a swarm to come forth, fearful
lest his favorites should, "like riches, take wing and fly away," a mischance
that it is desirable to prevent. In our description of natural
swarming this will be found fully treated of; we propose here merely
to point out how, with the moveable frames, this work of nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">- 80 -</span>
may be assisted&mdash;we say assisted, because artificial swarming should,
as nearly as possible, resemble natural swarming, that is, it should
be performed at the same time of the year, and when the populous
state of the hive makes a division desirable. This is easily known
to be the case when bees hang out in clusters at the entrance,
wasting their time in enforced idleness instead of being abroad
gathering honey. It is also necessary that the hive contain drones.</p>

<p>An empty hive should be placed on the stand when the living hive is
removed, for the purpose of amusing returning bees. If the hive is
kept in a bee-house, the entrance should be shut down unto the hive is
restored, when the clustered bees may be at once admitted.</p>

<p>When such is the state of the hive, the facility of forming an artificial
swarm with a moveable frame hive is a decided advantage. The
best time for performing the operation is about ten o'clock in the
morning of a fine summer's day. The following directions should be
carried out:&mdash;place ready a counter or bench that is firm and strong,
and which has space on it for the inhabited&mdash;or rather the over-inhabited&mdash;frame
hive and the empty one, which is about to be
made the receptacle of a separate stock. The operator having on
bee-dress and the other appliances ready, may now open the hive as
before described, and proceed to take out the frames, carefully
examining both sides of each comb to find the queen: she is
generally in the centre of the hive, so that it is not always needful
to take out all the ten frames. As they are examined, the frames
may be put into the empty hive, and when the object of the bee-master's
search is found, he must carefully remove the frame
containing her majesty, and may place it temporarily in the empty
hive at one end by itself. Next he must proceed to put the frames
back into the old hive, closing up the vacancy caused by the removal
of the comb with the queen on it, and leave the empty frame at the
end. Then he may place the frame containing the queen&mdash;with the
few bees that may be upon it&mdash;in the centre of the empty hive;
then putting all the other frames in, and replacing the lid, the bee-master
will place this hive in the exact position occupied by the old
stock. The bees that are on the wing will go to the old spot, and
finding the queen there, they will rally round her and very soon form
a sufficient number to constitute a swarm; comb building will at
once begin, the frames will in a week or so be filled, and a satisfactory
stock will thus be established. By doing this at the right
time, just before the bees are about to swarm, or when there are
many drones, all the trouble of watching and waiting for them is
saved. Mr. Woodbury claims the honour of having originated this
mode of artificial swarming; subsequently Mr. Langstroth and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">- 81 -</span>
others have described a similar process, no doubt originally, as far
as they knew, therefore still more useful to us as a confirmation of
the value of Mr. Woodbury's discovery.</p>

<p>This operation we performed, exactly as described above, with
one of our improved cottage hives one afternoon at the latter end
of May, 1862. Whilst inspecting our bees, we caught sight of the
queen on the comb in one of the bell glasses. This was a chance
not to be missed, and we immediately resolved to form an artificial
swarm, for the hive was very full of bees. Besides, being obliged to
be away from the apiary most of the week, we were glad of the
opportunity of so easily establishing a colony without the uncertainty
and trouble of hiving a natural swarm. In the first place we slid
a tin under the bell glass, and removing the stock hive from underneath
we took it a few feet away; then we placed an empty improved
cottage hive where the old stock had stood, and put the glass of comb
containing the queen and a few bees over one of the holes in the
crown of this new empty hive. The bees that were left abroad,
belonging to the old stock returned as usual to their old entrance
as they supposed; soon a sufficient number formed a large cluster
in the hive and began comb building, the queen remaining in the
glass until the cells below were sufficiently numerous for her to
deposit her eggs in them. The division answered exceedingly well,
both hives prospered; the old hive either had some princesses
coming forward to supply the loss of the queen, or the bees used a
power that they possess of raising a queen from worker brood in
the manner we have previously described.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> See <a href="#Page_5">Section 1, page 5</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing account illustrates the successful formation of an
artificial swarm; but with a cottage hive it was quite a matter of
accident to have been able to get possession of the queen. With a
moveable frame hive she can at any suitable time be found.</p>

<p>Precisely the same plan is to be adopted with the old stock in
the frame hive as we have described in the case of the cottage hive,
that is to remove it some few paces off: when the hives are in a
bee-house, a similar result may be attained by placing the new
swarm for a day or two to the entrance used by the bees when
with the old stock, and the old stock may be removed to an
approximate entrance. Some apiarians recommend that a space be
left between the two hives, by placing the hives on the right and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">- 82 -</span>
left of the old entrance, in order that too large a proportion of
bees should not enter the new hive at the old position to the
impoverishment of the other. But we have found the mode
adopted with the cottage hive answer so well, that we see no reason
for recommending any different plan.</p>

<p>It is the office of the bee-master to assist, not to go in the least
degree contrary to nature. We know that when a natural swarm
issues forth it has its impregnated queen, and when located in a
new abode commences building worker combs, and leaves the
building of the few drone combs to a later period; but if a division
of the hive should be made by putting half the combs in one hive
and half in another, the hive containing the queenless or embryo
queen will busy itself with building only drone comb, thus a number
of receptacles for useless bees is provided, which tends to weakness,
and eventually to loss of the hive.</p>

<p>In the plan we have recommended for forming two separate
families, we nearly follow the natural state of things; the comb that
the queen is upon is the only one that is taken from the hive, and
this vacancy should be filled in by moving the frames together
so as to leave the empty frame at the end. The bees, under the
government of the impregnated queen, construct the combs and furnish
their new abode, which, as before stated, they will do with worker cells.</p>

<p>By adopting the plan above described, the moveable bar and
frame hive will prove far superior to any of the dividing hives,
which provide for equal division of the combs.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest advantage the moveable frame hive
possesses is, that a full knowledge can be attained of its exact
state as regards the queen, the population and the quantity of food
in stock. During weather of a genial temperature, the combs may
on any fine day be inspected, and thus a knowledge being gained
of the deficiency existing in a hive, the necessary means may be
adopted for supplying the want. Sometimes such an examination
will verify the fears of the bee-keeper, when, having observed that
his bees have ceased to carry in pollen, he has thereby received
warning that the queen has been lost at some juncture when no
successor to the throne could be provided. Such a hive has entered
on a downward course, and will dwindle away entirely unless a
queen should be given to it, or else, some combs containing
young brood not more than three days old. By the latter method
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">- 83 -</span>
the bee-keeper will gain an opportunity of seeing the bees set about
their wonderful process of raising a queen from the brood thus
provided for them.</p>

<p>When a bee-keeper has become skilful in his calling, he may be
desirous to encourage the breeding of queens, or rather of preventing
their destruction. He will seek to use the propagating instincts of
the worker bees as a set off against that innate hatred of rivalry
which prompts the reigning queen to kill the tender royal brood.</p>

<p>Hives found to be queenless may be supplied either with
matured queens or with queen cells. If the latter are sufficiently
numerous, their introduction may easily be effected by exchanging
a comb in each hive; if they have to be cut out and placed loosely
in the new hive, a triangular piece of comb should then be removed
with them, to be used as a block in preventing any pressure coming
on them. A space must be cut out of the middle in the centre
combs of the hive into which they are to be introduced. Special
care must be taken not to bruise the royal embryos, as they are
particularly sensitive to pressure.</p>

<p>A very great advantage that the Woodbury bar and frame-hive
possesses, is the safety and convenience with which a stock of bees
can in it be transported to any part of the kingdom; and, by a
few additional arrangements, stocks have been sent in it to distant
countries. In many districts hives are removed to moors and
heaths in autumn, for the purpose of gathering heather honey.
In this operation the frames are a great support to the combs, very
much lessening the risk of a break down and consequent loss.</p>

<p>From a hive that has been inhabited all the winter, we have not
unfrequently lifted out the frames and removed the stock to a clean
hive, and we believe that the change has always been useful. The
bees find a clean floorboard and a clean hive to breed in, free from
insects that may have harboured in crevices about the hive. When
the change has been made, the old hive can be thoroughly cleaned,
and used in the same way for making the exchange with another
stock. The process for handling will, of course, be the same as
before described. We have found that where this plan has been
carried out, that the bees seem to progress faster. Perhaps a little
stirring up may be useful in arousing them from the winter doze;
the time we recommend for doing this is the beginning of April,
but a fine warm day should be chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">- 84 -</span></p>


<p id="DRIVING" class="caption3">DRIVING.</p>

<p>Driving is an operation by which bees are induced to vacate an
old settled hive and to enter an empty one. Many apiarians prefer
this mode of effecting an exchange of hives to the plan of fumigating
the bees.</p>

<p>The greatest success attending such a transfer will be in the
case of hives well filled with combs that are worked nearly to the
floorboard; and it may be remarked that bees are generally so far
provident, that they leave an open space in which to pass underneath
their combs over all the floor of the hive. When the old hive is
inverted, the bees crawl up the combs, and thus more easily pass up
into the new hive, which the operator places over the old one with
the intent that they should enter it.</p>

<p>The best time for performing this operation is about the middle
of the day, and when the weather is warm. It is essential that the
operator be protected with a bee-dress and gloves, as before
described; and previous to commencing his task, he must provide
all necessary implements. These are:&mdash;a couple of hives, one of
which should correspond in shape and size with the hive from which
the bees are to be driven; a cloth to tie round at the junction when
the new hive is placed on the old one; some string to keep the
cloth in its place; an empty pail to receive the top of the old hive,
if one of the old conical shape, but if the stock of bees is in a
square box hive with a flat top, a firm stool will be the best; and a
No. 12 fumigator with some fungus, which will complete the material
of war. The bucket or stool must be placed securely on the ground
about a yard from the place where the full hive stands; then a few puff's
of smoke being blown in amongst the bees, will cause them to retreat
up amongst the combs. The bee-master will now turn the hive<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
upside down very gently, letting it rest in the pail or on the stool;
he then quickly places the empty hive over the full one, and ties
the cloth round it to prevent any escape of the bees. If the cloth
be damped, it will cling the closer to the hives. The third hive is
intended to be placed on the stand formerly occupied by the stock,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">- 85 -</span>so as to retain the few returning bees which had been absent in the
fields. Care must be taken that all crevices through which it is
possible for the bees to escape from the united hives should be
effectually closed. When the two are fairly united, the operator
will proceed by rapping the full hive gently with the hands or a
couple of sticks, more particularly on that side where the combs
are the most thickly placed&mdash;that is, if the hive be not equally
filled.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Care should be exercised in turning the hives over to keep the combs
vertical, or they are likely to break from their foundations.</p>

</div>

<p>It generally happens that in about fifteen minutes the bees
regularly commence the ascent; their exodus will be known by
the distinct rushing sound which is always noticed when a colony
of bees is on the move. The first thing bees do when disturbed is
to till their honey bags, as they invariably do at swarming time,
consequently after the first rush into the new hive is over, as in the
case of a swarm, the "flitting" bees are not much disposed to take
wing. When the noise made by the ascending bees has been heard,
and has in good degree subsided, the cloth may be removed, and
the old hive, now deserted, may be taken indoors, and if a few bees
yet remain, they may be brushed off with a feather. An experienced
apiarian on first hearing the rushing noise before mentioned, will not
hesitate to tilt the top hive over a little on one side, so that he
may watch the bees during the ascent; the queen may be seen
passing up, and if the operator desires to take her away, he can
secure her by placing a wine glass over her. This expedient is often
resorted to in the autumn when stocks are to be united, for in such
a case the removal of the queen prevents some fighting.</p>

<p>If the taking of the honey be the object of the bee-master, then
"driving" is manifestly a better plan than to resort to the fumes
of sulphur for the purpose; for the bees from whom their store is
taken, can be joined to stocks that are weak in numbers, with
considerable advantage to the future prosperity of the apiary.</p>

<p>When the removed bees are to be joined to another stock, the
operator will proceed as follows:&mdash;At dusk, dislodge the bees on to
a cloth, sprinkle them with sweet syrup, and place the hive to
which it is intended to join them, over the mass; they will
gradually ascend into the hive placed for them, and early next
morning the hive, with its slender stock thus augmented, may be
removed to its stand. Should the operator not have been successful,
or not sufficiently skilful to gain possession of the queen, he may
leave it to the bees themselves to decide which queen they will have.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">- 86 -</span>
By this plan of "driving," artificial swarms may be secured by
an "expert" even in common hives, though those do not afford the
facilities for such a purpose as do the bar, or bar-and-frame, hives.</p>


<p id="CHANGING_OLD_STOCKS" class="caption3">CHANGING OLD STOCKS TO NEW HIVES.</p>

<p>We frequently find that the possessor of a stock of bees
in a cottager's common straw hive is desirous of removing the
whole stock of bees and comb into one of our improved hives,
in which the honey may be obtained without the destruction
of the bees. We mostly discourage such a transfer, attended
as it is with much labour, and requiring a considerable amount
of apiarian skill. An old fashioned hive may very readily be
rendered a humane one, simply by cutting out with a sharp pointed
knife the middle of the top of the hive; a piece may thus easily be
taken out, so as to leave a round hole two or three inches in diameter,
but care must be taken that the knife does not penetrate much below
the straw, lest it reach the comb or the bees&mdash;and it will be safer for
the operator to have a bee-dress on. There should be ready a round
adapting board, with a corresponding hole, which may be secured
on the top by putting four long nails through the same number of
holes in the board; then a cap hive or a glass may be placed on
the top, for the purpose of admitting the bees, who will soon crowd
therein to work.</p>

<p>This hive or glass will form a super or depriving hive, and
can be worked as profitably as most of the improved hives. Per
the sake of an improved appearance, an outside case, either of
zinc, straw, or wood, may be dropped over all, and then, if well
painted, the whole will form no disfigurement to any flower garden.</p>

<p>This is beyond doubt the easiest way of overcoming the difficulty,
but as it may not satisfy all, we now proceed to describe how a
complete transfer may be made. No hive offers such facilities for
the correct placing of the combs in a perfectly upright position as
does the bar and frame hive. As before remarked, we should be
slow to recommend any one to attempt the operation who is not
already pretty well accustomed to the handling of bees and
acquainted with their habits; but by carefully carrying out the
following directions any one may successfully perform the feat.
The first thing is to get the bees away from the combs; there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">- 87 -</span>
are two ways of doing this, one is by fumigation (see <a href="#Page_60">page 60</a>),
the other by driving (see <a href="#Page_84">page 84</a>). Whichever plan may be
resorted to, have the bees confined in the old hive on their stand
until you are quite ready to admit them into the bar and frame hive.
Have in readiness all the necessary appliances: these consist of a
large knife for cutting the hive, a good sized table on which to lay
the brood combs, a basin of water&mdash;for washing off honey which
may besmear the hands,&mdash;tape or cotton string to fasten the combs
in their frames, a pair of honey cutters for cutting out the combs,
jars to hold the honey that runs out, and a feather for brushing
off any bees that may remain. It is necessary that the operator
should have on his bee-dress, and India-rubber gloves. Then begin
by slicing off a piece of the hive with a sharp table knife; carefully
cut out the working combs&mdash;cut them large, so that they will squeeze
into the frames; and to be more secure, wind some of the tape
round to keep them in position until made fast by the bees. After
a few days, these fastenings may be removed. Care should be taken
that the combs occupy the same position in the frames as in the
hive from which they were extracted. Having thus prepared the
hive, the bees may be let into it. It may be as well to keep them
confined a few hours, giving them water at the top, until they make
the combs secure; the new hive will then be less likely to offer an
attraction to bees from other hives who, if feloniously inclined,
might come to rob. This transfer should be made when the
weather is such that the bees can fly about; when not warm enough,
it should be done in a room at a temperature of about 70 degrees.
An expert apiarian could perform the operation in less than three
quarters of an hour, and with little loss. A week or so after a
swarm has left the old stock is perhaps the very best time for such
a removal. Should the operation be performed in the open air, the
bees from surrounding hives will be sure to come in great numbers
to obtain a share of the honey necessarily exposed, for they delight
in plunder. In order, therefore, to avoid annoyance to the operator,
and the excitement which is certain to be induced in surrounding
hives, it is better to conduct the dissection in some building with
closed doors. In some instances a routing of this kind has a
beneficial effect; old stocks of hives that have previously appeared
to be dwindling, are often aroused to activity by their removal into
a fresh domicile.</p>

<p id="WEIGHING_HIVES" class="caption3">WEIGHING HIVES, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of the most effectual modes of ascertaining the condition of
a hive is by weighing it. Such knowledge is most important at
the close of the gathering season, in order that the bee-keeper may
determine whether he ought to give his bees artificial food to enable
them to live through the dreary winter. A knowledge of the
numerical strength of the colony is also useful, in enabling the
bee-keeper to decide which hives will be benefited by being joined
together, which may be done on the plan explained in the articles
on "Fumigation" and "Driving."</p>

<p>A hive can very easily be weighed, if a Salter's Spring Balance
be suspended near the apiary. The hive, having a strap or cord
passed under and over it, and crossing at right angles on the top,
may be hooked on to the balance, so that the weight will be indicated
on the dial. The weight of the hive should be marked on it when
empty, so that the exact amount of its contents may at any time be
ascertained. A colony of bees at Michaelmas ought to weigh from
20 to 24 pounds, that is, exclusive of the hive; if falling short
of that weight, the hive should be made up to it by the artificial
means before recommended.</p>

<p>Experienced apiarians are able to judge of the weight of a hive
by lifting it a few inches from the stand; or by looking in at the
windows of a stock hive, a conclusive opinion may be formed as to
the state of the colony. If the combs within view be well filled
and sealed, it will be safe to consider that the hive contains
sufficient stores to carry the bees through the winter.</p>

<p id="STINGS" class="caption3">STINGS: THEIR PREVENTION AND CURE.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may deem us neglectful in having, as it were,
left them to struggle through their bee-keeping novitiate without informing
them how to avoid being stung by their docile but well armed
flock. Of course, having described the bee-dress, we have supposed
that the apiarian was clad, if not "in complete steel," at least,
in the head-gear and gloves, which will render him invulnerable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">- 89 -</span>
The best safeguard from the anger of bees&mdash;as indeed from the malice
of men&mdash;is a quiet and peaceable spirit. The apiarian will learn to
handle his bees not only as "if he loved them,"&mdash;as the quaint
angler says&mdash;but as if he fully believes that the bees love him.
This they will do whenever he approaches and treats them gently.
There are some cases of exception to this generally peaceable disposition
of the bee; sometimes a few bees are dyspeptic, and
refuse to be pacified&mdash;let their master seek to bribe them never so
wisely. Then, too, sometimes the bee-master himself may be
dyspeptic, which the unerring olfactory sense of the bees speedily
detects, and their anger is immediately aroused. Some few persons,
owing to constitutional peculiarities in their breath or insensible
perspiration, are objects of constant animosity with bees, who by
driving them from the apiary, are giving a physician's advice without
charge for a fee. Some of the choicest perfumes used by ladies are
offensive to bees: and one may feel very certain that the "fine puss
gentleman," who disgusted the brave Hotspur with his "pouncet
box" and praise of "'parmaceti for an inward bruise," would
have been speedily driven from an apiary in ignominious flight.
Occasionally, even a skilful apiarian may inadvertently crush a single
bee; such a mischance is detected by the community with much
more facility than by any "crowner's quest," and their prompt
verdict decrees the summary punishment of the offender. There
would be much less fear of stings if it were always remembered
that bees are never aggressive. "Defence, not defiance," is their
motto. They scarcely ever attempt to sting when away from the
hive, and very seldom indeed at the time of swarming, for then they
are gorged with honey. When molested by angry bees, the safest
and best retreat is a green bush. Thrust your head into this, and
the bees will soon leave you.</p>

<p>Yet some people appear to think they must inevitably be stung
if they meddle with bees; and for their sakes it is needful to
explain why it is that a sting is painful, and how the wound
inflicted by the bee may be cured. Those familiar with the usual
microscopic objects will know how marvellously delicate, and yet
effective, is the mechanical structure of a bee's sting. This weapon
as we see it with our naked eye&mdash;finer than a needle's point&mdash;is
only the sheath, which lengthens or contracts like the tubes of
a telescope. From the sheath is projected the dart, which is double,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">- 90 -</span>
each half of it piercing alternately deeper into the wound made by
the sheath. The dart is barbed on each side, so that the bee when
very angry is scarcely ever able to withdraw it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Deems life itself to vengeance well resigned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Dies on the wound, and leaves the sting behind."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the patient who receives the sting could only take it patiently,
it would not prove half the inconvenience to him that often is the
case. There are indeed some happy mortals whose "blood such an
even tenour keeps," that a bee-sting is to them simply a puncture,
and nothing more. Dr. Bevan has suggested that lovers should
subject themselves to the ordeal of a bee-sting, in order to prove,
we suppose, that their temper is proof against "the <i>stings</i> and
arrows of any outrageous fortune" that matrimony can bring.</p>

<p>It is the hom&#339;pathically minute tincture of poison injected by the
bee which causes inflammation. The first thing to do is to remove the
sting, which, even when detached from the bee, will continue to penetrate
still further into the wound. Next, press the hollow point of a
watch-key exactly over the place stung; this will express a considerable
portion of the virus. Then dip the hand or bathe the part with
cold or tepid water, for the poison is volatile, and will thereby be
dissipated to a great extent. On no account whatever should the part
affected be rubbed; to do that will diffuse the poison, and increase the
inflammation. The specific remedy for a bee-sting is taught us by
chemistry: the venom is an acid, which an alkali will immediately
neutralize when brought into contact with it. Spirits of hartshorn
will generally be found effectual for the purpose, and should
always be kept in an apiary. There are also several other remedies,
more or less effectual, according to the special constitution of the
patient. A strong infusion of tobacco water applied to the wound
after the sting has been extracted, is a specific for many persons;
others find relief from the application of a sliced onion.</p>

<p>We have heard the remark from several who have kept bees for
years, that the poison from a sting has little or no effect on them;
after receiving many inflictions, their flesh appears to become
so little affected that the swelling and pain at one time experienced
no longer trouble them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">- 91 -</span></p>


<p id="POLLEN" class="caption3">POLLEN; OR, FOOD FOR INFANT BEES.</p>

<p>Bees, when fully grown, feed almost wholly on honey; but the
larv&aelig; require for their development a more substantial kind of
nourishment. Such solid fare is found by the bees in the pollen of
flowers, a farina which contains some of those nitrogenous elements
in which honey is deficient. The body of a worker-bee is covered
with hairs, to which the pollen adheres when, by contact with the
bee, it is rubbed from the anthers and stamens of flowers. The bee
with its fore legs then brushes it off, and moulds it into the pellet
shape suitable for carrying it in the "baskets" or grooves on its
thighs. Dewy mornings or humid bowers suit the bees for the
gathering of the pollen. If the atmosphere be too dry for
kneading it into pellets, they roll themselves in the blossoms,
and trust to the good offices of the bees at home, who, on their
return, brush off the farina into the cells intended for it, A
portion of this "bee bread" is taken at once by the "nursing
bees," which are supposed to subject it to some change before
offering it to the larv&aelig;; but the greater part of the pollen is stored
away, and sealed over in the cells for future use. In April and
May the bees are frequently busy "all the day" in gathering
pollen, and often one community of bees will collect about twenty
pounds weight of "bee bread" in one season.</p>

<p>One of the objects of the apiarian is to assist the bees in
providing for the nurselings of the hive. A German pastor, <span class="smcap">Heer
Dzierzon</span>, first suggested the plan of providing the bees with
"unbolted rye meal" as a substitute for the farina of flowers.
He had observed that, in early spring before the flowers were open,
his bees had entered a neighbouring corn mill, from whence they
returned laden with rye flour. Since his discovery, most bee-keepers
in early spring place either rye or wheat meal near the
apiaries; to this artificial store the bees repair by thousands, and
seem to rollick in the enjoyment of so much plenty, many of them
returning to the hive as dusty as millers. The object in thus
supplying them is, that the brood may be rapidly brought forward
and early swarming induced. In this way, a few pounds of rye
meal at one penny per pound may tend to the production of very
many pounds of honey of twelve times the price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">- 92 -</span></p>

<p>In gathering pollen from flowers, bees are doing more than
merely providing for their own community. Whilst humming
through our gardens they are assisting to propagate our flowers,
and their merry buzz in our orchards indicates that the blossoms of
spring will in autumn fulfil their promise by abundance of fruit.
In Mr. Darwin's remarkable work, "The Fertilization of Orchids,"
the mystery of the fructification of flowers is scientifically explained;
but before the subject was so fully understood, it was quite believed
that bees in passing from flower to flower performed some important
service. Owners of fruit trees have noticed, in a season generally
unfavourable for the orchard, that if during only one fine forenoon
the bees had spread freely amongst the blossoms of a particular
tree, that it would prove more fruitful than its fellows. On this
account the orchard is a good place for an apiary, for it seems&mdash;more
abundant the honey, more plentiful will be the fruit. Bees
bear the fructifying matter from one sex of flowers to the other,
but they confine their attention to one kind of flower during each
excursion: and the careful observer may see how the colour of the
pollen on the bodies of the bees will vary from yellow to red and
brown, according to the kind of flowers from which it has been
gathered. The gathering of pollen, its use by the nursing bees,
and the storing of it in the cells, afford to the bee-keeper opportunity
for observations of exceeding interest.</p>


<p id="PROPOLIS" class="caption3">PROPOLIS; OR, BEES' CEMENT.</p>

<p>The old notion that wax is gathered by bees from flowers as
they gather honey, has long since been set aside by the discoveries
of Hornbostel and Huber. Wax is an oily substance secreted from
the honey in the bodies of the bees, on which it forms in thin
flakes. But there is "a resinous substance, very tenacious and
semi-transparent," which is indispensable for the bees as a cement
wherewith to fix their combs and fortify their hives against intruders,
and this is "propolis." The bees, in working the propolis, often soften
it by blending it with a portion of wax; but they have to extract
it in its natural state directly from the bark and buds of certain
trees. The bark of the willow, the leaf buds of the poplar and
alder, and the unopened blossoms of the hollyhock, are very usual
sources of propolis. In the case of a new swarm, as bees must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">- 93 -</span>
have this glue before they can begin to build their combs, they
will resort to most unlikely places to obtain it. Sometimes they
will enter a paint shop and attack the varnish, and it is said they
have been seen to obtain propolis from the pitch and rigging of a
ship. These circumstances afford intelligible hints to the apiarian,
who, if his bees have not easy access to firs, poplars, or willows,
will provide some glutinous or resinous matter which may serve for
a substitute. The extracting of the propolis costs the bees very
considerable labour, which they should be relieved of as much as
possible, in order to facilitate their great work of honey gathering.
Bees choose the warmer part of the day during which to gather
propolis, as then it does not so rapidly stiffen. Frequently when
they arrive at the hive it has become so hard that the other bees
are scarcely able to gnaw it from their thighs.</p>

<p>With propolis bees fasten down their hives, stop up crevices to
exclude moths and ants, and sometimes use it to narrow the
entrance of their hive against the invasion of wasps. Extraordinary
anecdotes are told of the prompt and ingenious use they make of
this substance. Reaumur relates that a snail having been observed
by the bees on the window of the hive, they proceeded to glue the
shell to the glass, and there sealed down the intruder in hopeless
durance. In another case, that of a slug, or snail without a shell,
the bees having slain it with their stings, were quite unable to
remove it from the hive. With wonderful foresight, they then
proceeded to secure their community from the noxious effects likely
to arise from the decay of the carcase; and this they did by
completely enveloping it with a coating of impervious varnish.
Huish relates a similar occurrence in the case of a mouse caught
in a hive by bees. Propolis yields benzoic acid, and contains
some aromatic properties.</p>

</div>

<p>Apiarians generally agree in the opinion that very little can be
done in the way of providing any special forage for bees. Yet bee-fanciers
are always interested in observing which the flowers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">- 94 -</span>
that the bees prefer; and there are certain well established conclusions
as to the kind of district and season which are the likeliest to
produce a good honey harvest. There is an old saying that a
country which produces the finest wool also yields the best honey;
and a pastoral district is decidedly better than one under tillage.
The principle of the matter is, that the bees are best suited with a
long dry season&mdash;an early spring, a hot summer, and a late autumn.
As not one of these blessings can be commanded by the apiarian,
his art must be applied to provide some mitigation of the injury
suffered by the bees when the season is short or wet. For early
spring, the crocus, the blue hepatica, and the violet, all afford good
supplies of honey, and if cultivated near the apiary, will be of great
service when the wild flowers are backward. All varieties of the
willow and poplar furnish early supplies of honey, as well as of the
propolis of which we have spoken; the blossoms of the gooseberry
and currant are very useful for the bees in May. Wet, when it
enters flowers of any kind, prevents the proboscis of the bee from
reaching the secret source of honey. On this account, it is well
to know, as does the bee, that the drooping blossoms of the raspberry
escape the effect of the showers, and honey is gathered from
them when other flowers are drenched within as well as without.
For a similar reason, the borage (<i>borago officinalis</i>) is valuable for
bees; and, also, because that plant continues to flower until the frosts
set in. The honey both from raspberry blossoms and borage is very
superior. Mr. Langstroth says that "the precipitous and rocky
lands of New England, which abound with the wild red raspberry,
might be made almost as valuable as some of the vine-clad terraces
of the mountain districts of Europe." The "golden rod," and also
asters, afford superior honey for autumn gathering. Dzierzon
strongly recommends buck-wheat being sown in the winter stubbles
on behalf of the bees, and he tries hard to persuade farmers that it
is to their interest to cultivate it. It should be named that all the
ordinary fruit blossoms, especially those of the apple, supply
abundant store for bees.</p>

<p>It is, however, to wild or field flowers that the bee-master must
chiefly look for the raw material on which his myriad artisans shall
exert their skill. The white clover of the pasture&mdash;the wild thyme on
the hill&mdash;the heather on the moors&mdash;the furze and the broom on the
sandy waste&mdash;offer exhaustless stores for a greater number of bees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">- 95 -</span>
than can ever be located near them. There are also two or three
peculiar sources of honey which one would not have suspected, as, for
instance the blossoms of the onion plant, of turnips, and in still
greater degree, the flower of the mustard plant. In those districts of
England where mustard seed is cultivated so extensively, it would
be well worth while for the farmers to keep large colonies of bees.
Another, but a very uncertain source of honey, is the "honey-dew,"
which in some seasons appears in large quantities on the leaves of
the oak, the lime, and some other trees.</p>

<p>It is important to mention that bees in the principal breeding
season require a plentiful supply of water. Owing either to their
carelessness or eagerness, they are frequently drowned when
drinking from any large quantity of water; the bee-keeper should,
therefore, place near the hives shallow vessels of water containing
pebbles, on which the bees may alight to take frequent but
temperate draughts.</p>


<p id="LIGURIAN" class="caption3">THE LIGURIAN OR ITALIAN ALP-BEE.</p>

<p>A new, or rather a re-discovered, variety of bee has recently
been brought into practical use amongst apiarians in Germany and
America, as well as in this country. The ordinary bee is the <i>Apis
Mellifica</i> of naturalists; the new kind is the <i>Apis Ligustica</i>. It
was also named "The Ligurian Bee" by the Marquis de Spinola,
who found it in Piedmont in 1805; and he considered it to be the
principal species known to the Greeks, who speak of the "best
kind" of bee as being of a red colour. Leading apiarians agree in
pronouncing these bees to be justly entitled to the high character
given to them. Their special advantages are&mdash;greater fecundity of
the queens, less irascibility, and a more handsome appearance,
for being of a golden colour, they are prettier than our black bees.</p>

<p>Our own experience with the Italian Alp-bee enables us to
corroborate the statements which have been made in favour of this
new variety. We find the queens more prolific than those of the
common kind, and the quantity of honey produced is greater.
These two facts stand as cause and effect; the bees being multiplied
more quickly, the store of honey is accumulated more rapidly, and
the Italian bees consume, if anything, less food than the common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">- 96 -</span>
kind. When of pure Italian blood, these bees are by some apiarians
thought to be hardier than our own. That they forage for stores with
greater eagerness, and have little hesitation in paying visits to other
hives, we can testify from our own observation. The following
anecdote will illustrate their intrusive propensities. Another bee-keeper
living in the neighbourhood of our apiary, when inspecting
our hives, observed the yellow bees; he exclaimed, "Now I have
found out where those strange-looking bees come from; for," said
he, "these yellow-jackets are incessant visitors to my hives. I
thought they were a species of wasps that had come to rob, and
until now I have been unable to account for their appearance at
the entrance of my hive, so that I have killed them by hundreds."
This was not at all pleasing intelligence for us, and we trust that
our neighbour has been more lenient to "the yellow-jackets" since
his visit. We are inclined to believe that more visiting takes
place amongst bees of different hives than bee-keepers have been
accustomed to suppose; where the Italian and black bees are kept
near each other, the foreigners being conspicuous by their lighter
colour, there is less difficulty in identifying them when at the
entrances of other hives.</p>

<p>This season (1864) we have had more honey from a Ligurian
stock than from any one of our colonies of black bees. From this
Ligurian hive we have taken a glass super containing 40 lbs. nett
of honey, besides having drawn from it an artificial swarm; and,
after all, it remains the strongest hive in our apiary.</p>

<p>The Baron Von Berlepsch and Pastor Dzierzon, who are probably
the two most intelligent and skilful bee-keepers of Germany, award
to the Italian a very decided preference over the common bees. The
Baron says that he has found:&mdash;1. That the Italian bees are less
sensitive to cold than the common kind. 2. That their queens
are more prolific. 3. That the colonies swarm earlier and more
frequently. 4. That they are less apt to sting. 5. They are more
industrious. 6. That they are more disposed to rob than common
bees, and more courageous and active in self defence. They strive,
whenever opportunity offers, to force their way into colonies of
common bees; but when strange bees attack their hives, they fight
with great fierceness, and with incredible adroitness.</p>

<p>It is said, that the Italian bee can extract honey from some
flowers which the common bee is unable to penetrate. For instance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">- 97 -</span>
the blossom tubes of the red clover being too deep for the proboscis
of the common bee, that flower is useless to them, although so
plentiful; but, says Mr. Langstroth, the American apiarian, the
Italian bee visits the red clover assiduously, and draws large
quantities of honey from it.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> This opinion is not held by the closest observer of Italian bees in
England.</p>

</div>

<p>The introduction of this new variety of bee into England
was through our agency. M. Hermann, a bee cultivator at
Tamins-by-Chur, Canton Grison, Switzerland, wrote to us on the
5th July, 1859, offering to supply us with Italian Alp queen bees.
This letter, or an extract from it, appeared in the current number
of the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>, (then called the <i>Cottage Gardener</i>,)
a periodical that regularly opens its columns to apiarian subjects.
Prior to this the <i>Italian Alp</i>, or as it has been named the
"Ligurian" bee, was <span class="smcap">unknown in this country</span>, except to a few
naturalists. The letter referred to attracted the attention of that
intelligent apiarian T. W. Woodbury, Esq., now so well known as
the "Devonshire Bee-keeper." On the 19th of July, that is a
fortnight after Mr. Hermann's offer, we received a consignment of
Italian Alp bees, being the first imported into England, with these,
Mr. Woodbury also received one queen-bee and a few workers, which
he introduced into a hive of English bees from which the queen had
been taken. His efforts were very successful, and "the spring of
1860 found him in possession of four Ligurianized stocks." His
subsequent experience with the Italian Alp bee he has fully
described in a communication to <i>The Bath and West of England
Agricultural Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Subsequently Mr. Hermann sent us a copy of his pamphlet
entitled "The Italian Alp Bee; or, the <i>Gold Mine of Husbandry</i>,"
with the request that we should have it translated from the German,
and that copies of it should be printed in the English language.
The pamphlet was speedily published by us, and although singular
as a literary production, it may be useful for the advanced apiarian.</p>

<p>Certainly the bees are partially of an orange or golden colour,
and if one could believe the golden anticipations indulged in by
Mr. Hermann respecting them, it would be sufficient to identify
the Italian Alp bee as the species described by Hood in Miss
Kilmansegg;&mdash;those which dwelt in</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">Where golden bees, by alchemical prank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Gather gold instead of honey."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Poor Hermann himself did not profit by the discovery of the mine.
His enthusiasm for the culture of the Alpine bee instead of wafting
him to El Dorado appears to have driven him to the prosaic retreat
of a debtor's prison. By the latest accounts we learn that&mdash;his
ardent spirit chafing against his incarceration,&mdash;he had made an
attempt to escape, and in doing so, fell from the prison walls and
broke both legs. We understand that he has since died.</p>

<p>In the pamphlet referred to, Mr. Hermann gives the following
description of what he insists on designating as <i>Apis Helvetica</i>:&mdash;
"The yellow Italian Alp-bee is a mountain insect; it is found
between two mountain chains to the right and left of Lombardy
and the Rhetian Alps, and comprises the whole territory of Tessins,
Veltlin, and South-Graubunden. It thrives up to the height of
4,500 feet above the level of the sea, and appears to prefer the
northern clime to the warmer, for in the south of Italy it is not
found. The Alps are their native country, therefore they are called
<i>Yellow Alp-bee</i>, or tame house bees, in contra distinction to the
black European bees, whom we might call common forest bees,
and who, on the slightest touch, fly like lightning into your
face.(?)</p>

<p>"As all good and noble things in the world are more scarce
than common ones, so there are more common black bees than of
the noble yellow race, which latter inhabit only a very small piece
of country, while the black ones are at home everywhere in Europe,
and even in America."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the death of M. Hermann, we shall in future
be able to supply all bee-keepers, who may wish to possess stocks
of the genuine yellow Alpine bees.</p>

<p>The Italian varies but little from the common bees in its
physical characteristics. The difference in appearance consists in
the first rings of the abdomen, except the posterior edge, and
the base of the third&mdash;being of an orange colour instead of a
deep brown. These orange coloured parts are transparent when
closely examined with the sun shining on them. The Italian bees
are more active than common bees when on the wing.</p>

<p>During the summers of 1859 and 1860 we had over from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">- 99 -</span>
Continent a great number of Ligurian queens; these were sent to
all parts of the kingdom. We regret to say that but few were
successfully united to English stocks. It requires a considerable
amount of apiarian skill to accomplish the union, so that we find
by experience it is best to send out complete Ligurian stocks. This
is particularly desirable now that the packing of whole hives is so
easily accomplished by us with the aid of bars and frames. We
have sent a great number of stocks to all parts by rail.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury, owing to his knowledge and skill in bee-keeping,
was eminently successful in propagating the Ligurian
bees first imported into this country; and we would recommend all
who may be interested in the subject, to peruse the interesting
articles written by him in the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>. He has
shown great patience and energy by his labours in the rearing of
queens and the multiplication of stocks, for which he merits all
praise. On the other hand, Mr. Woodbury has to thank the
Ligurian bees for the development of his own skill, for although
prior to this he was a valued correspondent to the before named
Journal, his commencement of scientific bee-keeping must be dated
from the time of their introduction.</p>

<p>We now add to the other testimonies already cited, that of Mr.
Woodbury as to the superior qualities of the Ligurian bees. The
following is extracted from a paper contributed by him to the <i>Bath
and West of England Agricultural Journal</i>:&mdash;"From my strongest
Ligurian stock I took eight artificial swarms in the spring, besides
depriving it of numerous brood-combs. Finding in June that the
bees were collecting honey so fast that the queen could not find an
empty cell in which to lay an egg, I was reluctantly compelled to
put on a super. When this had been filled with. 88 lbs. of the
finest honey-comb,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I removed it, and as the stock-hive (a very
large one) could not contain the multitude of bees which issued
from it, I formed them into another very large artificial swarm.
The foregoing facts speak for themselves; but as information on
this point has been very generally asked, I have no hesitation in
saying that I believe the Ligurian honey-bee infinitely superior in
every respect to the only species that we have hitherto been
acquainted with."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> This super was exhibited at our stand in the International Exhibition
of 1862.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">- 100 -</span></p>

<p>After such decided testimony as this, corroborated, as it is, by
many other observers, there seems every reason to expect that the
Ligurian bee will gradually supersede the common kind throughout
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The engraving represents our stand in the Agricultural
Department of the International Exhibition of 1862. The space
granted us in the World's great Fair was somewhat limited; but
we were able to exhibit a tolerably complete stock of apiarian
apparatus and all the more important bee-hives. Amongst these
was a Unicomb Hive stocked with the Yellow Alpine or "Ligurian"
bee. This was an object of great attention, and daily hundreds of
visitors flocked round our stand in order to watch the movements
of the Italian queen with her gay and busy subjects. The entrance
way for the bees being in the "Open Court," to which all visitors
had access, it was necessary to place the hive in an elevated position,
so as for it to be beyond the reach of incautious passers by, and to
obviate any chance of annoyance to the vast crowds of people continually
around.</p>

<p>Among others who took a deep interest in our exhibition, was
Mr. Edward Wilson, President of the Acclimatisation Society of
Victoria. This gentleman requested us to pack four stocks of the
Ligurian bees for conveyance to Melbourne. With the assistance
of Mr. Woodbury&mdash;whose aid was, indeed, essential&mdash;these stocks
were sent off on the 25th of September, 1862, by the steam
ship Alhambra, so as to arrive at the colony during the Austral
summer. The hives were Woodbury-frame hives, having ample
space and ventilation, as well as the means of supplying water to
their inmates during the voyage; there was, also, a sufficient store
of honey to last until the following March. The bees arrived at
Melbourne, where they were released after an imprisonment of
seventy nine days, and have since rapidly multiplied, the climate
and pasturage of Australia greatly favouring the increase of this
superior variety of the bee.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson was so well pleased with the careful manner in
which these stocks were fitted out for their voyage across the seas,
that he subsequently instructed us to prepare him three more hives,
which were sent out in a sailing vessel. Owing to the mismanagement
of the water supply during the voyage, only one stock
survived in this instance.</p>

<p>Upwards of twenty years ago, we sent a Nutt's Hive stocked
with bees to New Zealand. We then adopted the plan of fixing
the hive in a meat safe, so that the bees could fly about a little, and
also cleanse the hive of their dead, for bees are very attentive to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">- 102 -</span>
sanitary arrangements; they always remove the dead ones from
their midst, and do not void excrement within the hive.</p>

<p>When bees are shut up in their hives too long, they are apt to
be attacked by a disease called by apiarians&mdash;dysentery. Sometimes
when confined by the unfavourableness of the weather in winter
or the lateness of spring, this disease produces serious mischief
amongst the bees. Various remedies have been recommended;
but we believe the best is to see that there is wholesome food
within the hive, and plenty of it, and when fine weather returns,
the health of the bees will return with it. Dampness of the hives,
and too late feeding in the autumn, are also frequent causes of
this disease.</p>


<p id="BEE_KEEPING" class="caption3">BEE-KEEPING IN LONDON.</p>

<p>There are many persons now in this noisy city pent, who frequently
remember the days of childhood when, among pastures of clover or
amidst flowery heath and woodlands, they listened to the cheerful hum
of bees. Partly from a desire to revive those old associations, and
also from a natural liking for the tendance of living creatures, such
persons would be glad to keep bees if they thought it possible to do so in
London or its suburbs with any chance of success. We do not wonder
that many should doubt even the possibility of bees feeding themselves
amidst such an "endless meal of brick;" but we can easily
prove that bees, if not placed too near to smoky chimneys, are able
to produce honey, both for themselves and for their masters. To
make this plain, we will mention some special instances of metropolitan
bee-keeping.</p>

<p>About ninety years ago, a Mr. Wildman kept a bee-house and
honey warehouse near to Middle Row, Holborn. He was not only
a tradesman, but was also the apiarian of his day. He kept hives
of thriving bees on the roof of his house in Holborn, and many of
the nobility and gentry used to mount thither in order to inspect
the apiary. At that period, St. Pancras was a "village two miles
north-west of London," and what is now the Regent's Park was
open country. It was then much easier for London bees to find
their favourite forage, but Mr. Wildman believed that his hives
were filled with stores from a considerable distance. Whilst
enjoying his country rambles on Hampstead Heath, he had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">- 103 -</span>
shrewd suspicion that many of the bees he there observed gathering
honey were Labourers from his own apiary. In order to identify
his own flock amongst the rest, he hit upon a homely but very
effective expedient. Having borrowed Mrs. Wildman's "dredging
box," he stationed himself near the entrance of his hives, and
gently dusted his bees with flour as they issued forth. He then
betook himself to Hampstead, where he found his previous surmise
confirmed, for there were numbers of his bees in their livery of
white.</p>

<p>Wildman became noted for the remarkable control he obtained
over his bees, many instances of which he exhibited before the
public. Many of his operations with them were regarded as feats
of legerdemain by the uninitiated, as when he appeared before
the king George III. with a swarm of bees hanging in festoons
from his chin, or suspended in a cluster at arm's length. The
Journal of Horticulture recently, in alluding to Wildman, gives the
following particulars as to his performances:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Near the "Three Hats," Islington, was a place of popular entertainment
called "Dobney's Tea Gardens," kept by Mrs. Ann Dobney. These gardens
occupied the ground between White Lion Street and Winchester Place, and
were established as far back as 1728. In 1771 the house was taken for a
short time as a boarding school; but it was soon changed to its original
purpose as a place of amusement, for in 1772 Daniel Wildman exhibited bees
here. This is a copy of the advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"June 20, 1772. Exhibition of bees on horseback! at the Jubilee
Gardens, Islington, (late Dobney's), this and every evening until further
notice (wet evenings excepted.)</p>

<p>"The celebrated Daniel Wildman will exhibit several new and amazing
experiments, never attempted by any man in this or any other kingdom before.
The rider standing upright, one foot on the saddle and one on the neck, with
a mask of bees on his head and face. He also rides standing upright on the
saddle with the bridle in his mouth, and by firing a pistol, makes one part of
the bees march over the table, and the other swarm in the air and return to
their hive again, with other performances too tedious to insert. The doors
open at six; to begin at a quarter before seven. Admittance:&mdash;Box and
gallery, 2s.; the other seats. 1s."</p>
</div>

<p>The secret of Wildman's skilful manipulation is well understood
now; it consisted in a careful holding and disposal of the queen,
together with confidence in the generally inoffensive disposition of
bees. Dr. Evans, whom we have often quoted for his correct
information in apiarian matters, thus speaks of his feats:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">- 104 -</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent1">Twined in dark wreaths the fascinated swarm;</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Or with a living garland bound his head.</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Or o'er her folds the silken fetter fling."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To recur to our subject. After the days of Wildman, our own
establishment in Holborn became widely known for bee hives and
honey. Although we never attempted to start a London apiary
at all approaching in extent that of our predecessor, we have
occasionally kept bees on the house top both in Holborn and
Regent Street. At both those situations, we have noticed that the
bees bring "pollen" as well as honey into their hives. Last summer
there was brought under our notice an illustration of the acuteness
of the scent of bees, and of their diligent search for food, proving
too that if sweets can be obtained even from unusual sources, the
bees will find them out. A poor woman who, at the corner of an
adjacent street vends "brandy balls," "toffee," "rock," and other
saccharine compounds&mdash;all well known to and appreciated by most
juveniles,&mdash;used to receive frequent visits from our bees. Their
visits to the old dame's domain were at first rather interesting, and
if the few pioneers who had the sagacity to find such a store had
kept the secret only to themselves, their company would not have
been objected to. Such selfish policy does not, however, accord
with the social instinct of bees, and these soon informed their
companions of the good fortune provided for them in an archipelago
of sugar islands. Day by day the swarms of these uninvited visitors
increased, until all legitimate customers were beaten off; and the
old dame had to see, not only her hope of gain destroyed, but her
stock of "goodies" sensibly diminishing by the thefts of these
brigands of the air. She could not, or dare not attempt to, drive
the intruders away, so made diligent enquiry as to where the
robbers were harboured. Having traced them to our establishment
in Regent Street, she came to implore of us to move the bees if
possible, or she would have to move her stall, and so lose her
"connection" in the "toffee" and "rock" trade. Wishing not
to hinder the poor woman in gaining her livelihood, we decided on
removing our bees into the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">- 105 -</span></p>

<p>It is difficult to assign an exact limit to the distance that bees
will go in search of honey yielding blossoms. It has been proved
by various experiments that they will fly say five or six miles, if the
supplies are scanty within a shorter radius; but bees well understand
that first of all economies,&mdash;the saving of time, and if they can
find forage near at hand, they prefer it. Hence, other things being
equal, the quantity of honey stored will be in proportion to the
contiguity of good pasturage. In this way it is that the systematic
removal of hives, as practiced in many districts, has such a notable
effect on the honey harvest.</p>

<p>During several years we kept bees in the Zoological Gardens,
Regent's Park, and have there frequently taken full and handsome
glasses of honey. The position of our apiary was on the site now
occupied by the "New Monkey House." The Society promise to
erect a new building for an apiary in the course of the ensuing
summer. The visitors to the Gardens found considerable interest
in watching the bees in our glass hives, and are now much
disappointed at the absence of so entertaining an exhibition.</p>

<p>A gentleman residing in St. James's Place, has for some
considerable time past kept bees in his garden there. He uses
our improved cottage hives, and his bee-keeping is decidedly
successful as he generally takes some fine glasses of honey each
season, besides leaving sufficient as winter store for the bees. For
a London situation, St. James's Place is a very favourable one;
the gardens behind the houses pleasantly face the Green Park, so
that the bees have an uninterrupted flight to start with. They are
also within easy range of the richly flowered gardens of Buckingham
Palace and those of the nobility and gentry who reside around
the Parks. To those gardens the bees of St. James's Place resort,
without waiting for any license or certificate from the royal and
noble owners of the honey yielding preserves. Being within a
short distance of our establishment, when this gentleman's bees
swarm he generally sends to us for assistance in hiving them.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of St. John's Wood, and indeed almost all
the suburbs of London, are favourable for the production of honey.
We mention St. John's Wood because, from the fact of having
kept bees there ourselves, we are able to prove by our experience
that they do well in that locality. We have several customers on
nearly all sides of the town, who have each had this year a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">- 106 -</span>
considerable surplus of honey in their "supers," after leaving
sufficient for the bees themselves in the lower or stock hives.</p>

<p>We exhibited in our window last autumn a super of fine
honey from the apiary of Shirley Hibberd, Esq., the proprietor and
editor of the <i>Gardiner's Weekly Magazine</i>. It is a box containing
20 lbs. nett weight of honey, and was produced at Stoke Newington,
only 3&frac14; miles from the General Post Office.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> "Bee-Master," whose letters from Tunbridge Wells
have awakened so much interest in this pleasing pursuit, also
commissioned us to exhibit a "super," produced under his own
management in that locality. A friend of ours at Exeter had
upwards of 400 lbs. of honey, of excellent quality, though one
of his apiaries is quite within the city.</p>

<p>The last has been an excellent honey yielding season; our own
bees, at Dorking, in Surrey, have produced us large quantities, and
the accounts from nearly all parts of the country coincide in stating
that the bees have in the year, 1864, enjoyed unusual opportunities
for accumulation. In not a few localities, the season of 1863 was
even more abundant.</p>

<p id="WASP_MOTHS" class="caption3">WASPS AND MOTHS.</p>

<p>Bees have few enemies more formidable than wasps. The most
effectual method of checking their invasion of hives, is to have as
narrow an entrance as the bees can do with. If a stock be not
very weak in numbers, the bees will be well able to guard a small
aperture, and can repel the attacks of those insidious and merciless
robbers. On this account, the entrance to our No. 5 hive as
described at <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>, may be used.</p>

<p>The bee-keeper is interested in preventing the increase of
wasps; it is, therefore, a good practice for him to set a price on
queen wasps in the spring, the death of one of them at that time
being equivalent to the destruction of a whole nest.</p>

<p>Should nests be found in the neighbourhood of an apiary, their
annihilation must be accomplished either by blowing them up with
gunpowder, an operation well understood by most country lads;
or any other effectual method. The late Mr. Payne recommended
that a small quantity of gas tar should be put into the mouth of a
wasp's nest, and if then covered with earth, the total destruction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">- 107 -</span>
the wasps will be accomplished without further trouble. But to
use blazing straw for the purpose is always dangerous in country
districts. We have lately heard of a very ingenious and successful
mode of entrapping and killing wasps. Place some sugar or
strongly sweetened compound on the ground in a garden, and
place over it a square hand glass, wedged up an inch or so all
round. On this glass, which should have an opening at the
apex, lodge another, but a sound one. The wasps, attracted by
the sweets, will soon crowd under the lower glass, and when they
have well feasted, will ascend into the upper one; there, between
the two, they soon become scorched and perish by the heat of the
sun shining on the outer glass.</p>

<p>The season of 1864 was most productive for the increase of
these prime pests of the apiary, and many hives have severely
suffered by their depredations. When once wasps in any number
have gained an entrance into a hive, the bees can seldom eject them,
and the invaders generally remain until they have freely regaled
themselves from the luscious store. They not only consume the
honey, but cause a good deal of worry to the legitimate inhabitants
of the hive, as well as killing the foremost defenders of it. Wasps
being of so much superior strength, it requires, at least, three bees
to master one of them.</p>

<p>Having suffered loss in our own apiary from the attacks of
wasps, we feel it desirable to give a detailed account of our own
troubles from that cause. One of our Ligurian stocks was besieged
and worried by wasps to such an extent, that the bees deserted it
on the 5th of September, (1864). Fortunately, the bees chose a
time for their departure just as we visited the apiary. An unusual
turmoil was heard in the hive, such as is experienced at the time of
swarming, and on immediately examining the entrance, we observed
that the bees were quitting in tumultuous haste. The usual
methods that induce bees to settle were tried&mdash;amongst others,
that of throwing sand up into the air, so as it should fall down
amongst the bees on the wing; but they were dispersed in disorder,
and their flight extended over three adjacent gardens. We only
discovered the clustered bees by diligent search, as the sequel will
show. Permission being asked of our next door neighbour, we
searched his garden to see if our bees had alighted there; but
found that they had passed over. Making a similar application to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">- 108 -</span>
the owner of the garden adjoining, we entered, having a straw hive
in hand, but no bees were there. After looking diligently all
round, and climbing the wall, thereby gaining a view of the third
garden, we perceived in it unmistakable signs of an unwonted
commotion. The occupiers of the house were intently looking at a
particular part of the garden, and there was a dustpan and a key,
with which the master had been "tanging the bees" to induce them
to settle. We quickly made for the proper entrance to the garden,
and soon discovered our little wanderers clustered to a large flower
vase. Our neighbours, however, were sadly disappointed of their
prize, for the gardener had hastily been dispatched into the town
to purchase a hive for the welcome colonists. In depriving our
neighbours of so unexpected and cheaply acquired a treasure, we
could sympathise with their regret, having been much disheartened
half-an-hour before at our own loss; but, of course, we could do
no other than claim our own bees. We gladly agreed to defray
the expense of the straw hive that had been purchased for the sake
of our truant swarm. After brushing the bees into the hive, and
leaving it propped up with a stick, in order that the stray ones
might join, we returned home for an hour or so, to give them time
to settle. Judge of our vexation when on returning to fetch the
hive home, we found that the refractory creatures had again
taken flight, and that all the work was to do over again. The
wasps were not to blame for this second flight of the Ligurians;
we judged that the swarm had been disturbed by visits from a
colony of bees that we discovered were living the life of outlaws
under the roof of an adjoining house. Although much disheartened
and perplexed, we at once renewed our search, and, upon enquiry,
found that the missing bees had taken a southerly course across the
turnpike road, and it was therefore necessary to ask permission to
search the gardens of the houses opposite. From one of these we
observed, on looking through the hedge, that the inhabitants of the
next house were on the <i>qui vive</i>. On enquiring whether they had
seen a colony of bees, the wary old dame replied that she "had no
bees but her own," and added that "they were very much excited."
Having asked permission to go through the hedge to look at her
bees, we soon discovered our Ligurians on the top of the old lady's
bee-house. There was no difficulty in identifying our own bees;
their yellow rings were as good as a private mark. Quickly hiving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">- 109 -</span>
the swarm, we took them home, and replaced them in the hive they
had quitted. It was almost destitute of honey; but by liberal
feeding, and lessening the entrance so that only one bee at a time
could find ingress or egress, we succeeded in inducing them to rest
in their old home. Thus nearly half a day's exertion was needed
to save a fine colony, which would otherwise have been utterly lost
by the power of the relentless wasps.</p>

<p>Much watchfulness is needed to prevent the loss of swarms, and
the foregoing incident may serve to suggest the necessity of
having hives so located as to be constantly within view, either from
the dining room, or of those whose duties oblige them to be near
the apiary. If we had not happened to be at hand at the moment
this colony started, it would have been irretrievably lost to us.
Many swarms and colonies are lost simply because the departure
takes place without any one witnessing it. Let us hope that runaway
bees may always fall into the hands of those who are as
capable of taking care of them as our neighbours appeared to be on
the occasion we have described.</p>

<p>Another formidable enemy of bees are the moths. These insects
are creatures of the night, as the bees of the day, and they make
their way into the hives under cover of darkness, in spite of the bee-sentinels.
They deposit their eggs in any crevices in or near the
hive that they can find. There the warmth of the hive or of the
sheltered situation, causes the eggs speedily to hatch, and then the
maggots soon work their way to the comb and larv&aelig; food, which
they greedily devour, thereby often bringing about the gradual but
certain destruction of the whole community of bees. The best way
of keeping moths outside the hives is to lessen the entrance, as
before alluded to. Also, in the early spring, the hives should be lifted
from their floorboards, which must then be made thoroughly clean,
and all crevices and corners about the hive and stand should be
scraped, so as to get rid of all eggs of moths and other insects
before the warm weather hatches them or enables them to do
mischief. The bee-moth is not so troublesome in England as it is
in America and some parts of Germany; but still its encroachments
should be carefully guarded against in this country, for if not, it
may easily increase to a very serious extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">- 110 -</span></p>


<p id="DRAINING" class="caption3">DRAINING HONEY FROM THE COMBS.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who prefer eating "run honey" to honey
in the comb, may be glad of some instruction as to the best way of
separating the two. For this purpose, it is better to let the honey
run without squeezing, in order to preserve both its transparency
and flavour.</p>

<p>Take a sharp knife, and slice the combs on both sides, keeping
the knife parallel with the partition wall, so that every cell may be
laid open. Place these broken combs in a sieve, or on a piece of
muslin stretched across and tied round the opening of a pan or
large mouthed jar. Allow the honey to flow out of the combs
spontaneously, and reserve the squeezing process for a separate jar,
so that the honey of the first drained jar may be perfectly pure,
both in appearance and flavour. That which has pressure put on it
will be waxy in flavour and thick. Some persons recommend that
the opened combs be placed in the sun, as the heat will cause the
honey to run more freely. The great disadvantage of this is, the
temptation the honey will offer to bees, who will be eager to gain a
share. Honey whilst in the combs keeps remarkably well when left
in the supers; if cut out, the combs should be folded in writing
paper and sealed up, so as effectually to prevent free entrance of
air; they should then be placed in a warm dry closet.</p>

<p>Honey, like most vegetable products, should be fresh every
year. It may easily be kept from one season to another; but
when kept beyond that time, unless very carefully stored in a
warm temperature, it will crystallize in the comb, and it is liable to
ferment when in jars separated from the comb.</p>


<p id="GEN_REMARKS" class="caption3">GENERAL REMARKS.</p>

<p>Every bee-keeper should be a book-keeper; that is, so far
as to have a permanent record of the events of the apiary
and the fortunes of his bees. A book similar to a tradesman's
journal would be very suitable for the purpose. In it he should
note down the date of the first swarm of the season especially, and
those of the other swarms also; and in autumn, the quantity of
honey taken from each hive should be entered, with remarks on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">- 111 -</span>
probable size of the various stocks. These particulars will not only
be interesting for the bee-keeper to turn to in winter, but will be of
practical service in enabling him to know the exact age and
probable strength of each stock. The bee-book may also be contrived
to show the total amount of honey that the bees have produced for
their owner, and the net money profit of the apiary. A simple
and clear account Like this&mdash;provided, by the bye, that it does
show a satisfactory balance&mdash;will be very useful for inducing
cottagers and farm labourers to start bee-keeping. Nothing like
ocular demonstration for this class. The "humane" apiarian will
reason with them in vain until he shows them a monster "skep" of
honey, and mentions the price that it will fetch in the market.
When convinced that the depriving system will pay, the cottager
will gladly adopt it.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> gives the following good
advice:&mdash;"Don't bore the cottager with long lectures; don't heap
upon him many little books; but give him a hive of the best
construction, show him the management, and then <i>buy his honey;</i>
<i>buy</i> all he brings, even though you should have to give the surplus
to some gardenless widow. But only buy such as comes from an
improved hive&mdash;and you cannot easily be deceived in this,&mdash;one
which preserves the bees and betters the honey. Then, <i>when you
pay him</i>, you may read to him, if you will, the wise rules of old
Butler," <i>exempli gratia</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If thou wilt have the favour of thy bees that they sting thee not, thou
must not be unchaste or uncleanly; thou must not come among them with a
stinking breath, caused either through eating of leeks, onions, or garlic, or by
any other means, the noisomeness whereof is corrected by a cup of beer; thou
must not be given to surfeiting or drunkenness; thou must not come puffing
or blowing unto them, neither hastily stir among them, nor violently defend
thyself when they seem to threaten thee; but, softly moving by, thy hand
before thy face, gently put them by; and, lastly, thou must be no stranger to
them. In a word, (or rather, in five words,) be chaste, sweet, sober, quiet,
familiar; so they will love thee and know thee from all others."</p>
</div>

<p>Allusion having been made to the profit that may be gained by
the judicious management of bees, we will illustrate that point by
relating an anecdote of a certain French <i>cur&eacute;</i>.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is one which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">- 112 -</span>
may be suggestive to some of the rural clergy in this country, who
might almost as easily keep an apiary as they do a garden or an
orchard.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> This story, in a disguised form, or&mdash;as the writer would say&mdash;an improved
form, was quoted in the Cornhill Magazine some time ago. In transforming
the bee-keeping cure into an English clergyman the effect was cleverly</p>

</div>

<p>A good French bishop, in paying his annual visit to his clergy,
was very much afflicted by the representations they made to him of their
extreme poverty, which indeed the appearance of their houses and
families corroborated. Deploring the sad state of things which had
reduced them to such a condition, he arrived at the house of a
curate who, living amongst a poorer set of parishioners than any he
had yet visited, would, he feared, be in a still more woful plight
than the rest. Contrary, however, to his expectations, he found
the appearance of this remote parsonage to be superior to those he
had already visited. Everything about the house wore the aspect
of comfort and plenty. The good bishop was amazed. "How is
this, my friend," said he, "you are the first pastor I have met
with having a cheerful face and a plentiful board! Have you any
income independent of your cure?" "Yes, Sire," said the pastor,
"I have: my family would starve on the pittance I receive from
the poor people that I instruct. If you will walk into the garden,
I will show you the stock that yields me such excellent interest."
On going into the garden, he showed the bishop a long range of
bee-hives. "There," said he, "is the bank from which I draw an
annual dividend, and it is one that never stops payment." His
harvest of honey enabled him almost to dispense with the use of
sugar, leaving him a considerable quantity of it for disposal in the
market; of the coarser portions he made a tolerable substitute for
wine, and the sale of his wax nearly paid his shoemaker's bill.
Ever afterwards, when any of the clergy complained to the bishop
of poverty, he would say to them "Keep bees! keep bees!"
In this succinct advice, extending it to laity as well as clergy in
rural districts, we heartily join, believing that in this country a ten
times greater number of hives might be successfully kept than are
now established. In a very practical sense, the oft repeated lines
of Gray are strictly true:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And waste its fragrance on the desert air."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>enhanced, especially as to the dismay of the decorous English prelate in
hearing that his poor brother in the Church had turned "manufacturer;" but
then the <i>vraisemblance</i> of the story, as we have it, was destroyed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">- 113 -</span>
An apiary in the garden of every village clergyman would afford the
means of economising this unclaimed bounty of Providence.</p>

<p>Bees may be very inexpensively and profitably kept in the
Cottager's hive (see <a href="#Page_34">page 34</a>), which will be found a very productive
one. It is true that it has not the appliances of windows and bell
glasses; for the cottager is not supposed so much to care for his
hives as a source of amusement; his object in bee-keeping is simply
the profit it may bring. For those of our readers who wish to have
united the facility of observing the bees with that of the plentiful
production of honey, we would especially recommend the "Improved
Cottage" hive, described at <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>. If inclined to go to a little
further expense, the hives numbered 1, 2, 3, and 7, all afford
constant opportunity for inspection of the bees, and allow of their
working freely in the most natural manner.</p>

<p>There are few hobbies which cost so little outlay as the keeping
of bees. Once the "plant" of hives is purchased, there is little,
if any, additional expense, and always a probability of a fair return.
If honey be obtainable, the bees will find it; they work for nothing,
and provide themselves with sustenance, requiring only a very
little labour from their keepers, and that labour is of a pleasing and
instructive kind.</p>

<p>To the advanced and skilful apiarian we would especially
commend the use of the Bar-and-frame hives. With these, as we
have attempted to show, the bee-keeper has a full command over
his hives and bees. Many mistakes, it is true, have been made by
uninitiated bee-keepers in using the more elaborate hives. Being
struck with the remarkable facilities afforded by these superior hives
for the extraction of any one comb, and, perhaps, fascinated with their
easy sway over so highly organized a community, these new-fangled
bee-keepers have acquired a habit of perpetually and incautiously meddling
with the bees. The inevitable results in such cases are distress
to the bees, impoverishment of the stocks, and loss and vexation to
the over zealous apiarian. All these things may be avoided, if it
be remembered that there are first steps in bee-keeping, as well as in
croquet, chemistry, or cricket. In bee-keeping, as in floriculture
it is a great point to know when to "let well alone." There is no
florist, however anxious for a prize, who would be continually
pulling up his plants to see how their roots were growing. Doubtless,
the full control which the bars and frames afford over the inmost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">- 114 -</span>
recesses of the hives, is a great temptation to the bee-keeper; but,
if he yields too readily to it, he will imperil his chance of profit,
and deprive himself of that continuous source of interest, which a
judicious apiarian always enjoys.</p>

<p>Many persons who are well informed on most subjects, are
extraordinarily ignorant of the natural history of bees, and the
economy of the bee-hive. Perhaps we might venture to suggest
that, more pains should be taken at schools or by parents to inform
young persons on this, in connection with kindred subjects. As an
amusing illustration of the ignorance referred to, we transcribe an
order we received a short time since from a seminary in the north
of England. The young gentleman thus writes:&mdash;"Master &mdash;&mdash;
presents his compliments to Messrs. Neighbour, and begs they will
send him a swarm of bees; he encloses <i>six postage stamps</i>, and
hopes they will send him a <i>good</i> swarm." This embryo naturalist
was evidently of a mercantile turn, and had a mind to buy in
the cheapest market, for in a postscript he adds:&mdash;"Please let it
be fourpence, if you can!" We need scarcely say that in reply we
endeavoured to enlighten our juvenile correspondent as to what
constituted a swarm of bees, and returned the stamps, with our thanks.</p>

<p>The culture of bees would be greatly promoted, if a knowledge
of it were considered necessary as one of the regular qualifications
of a gardener. So little time is needed to gain the skill requisite
for the tendance of an apiary, that it seems only reasonable to
expect it of a well taught gardener, and he should feel a pleasure in
the circumstance of its forming a part of his duties. In Germany,
where a country gentleman's table is kept constantly supplied with
fresh honey, the gardeners are expected to understand the management
of hives; and in Bavaria, modern bee culture is taught in the
colleges to all the horticultural students. Travellers in Switzerland
will call to mind the almost invariable practice of placing new honey
on the breakfast tables at hotels in that country.</p>

<p>Some writers on bee-culture attach much importance to the
particular position in which an apiary stands, and the aspect
towards which it faces. A southern, or rather a south-eastern
aspect is the one which we have already recommended. Our reason
for this preference is, that we deem it very important for the bees
to have the first of the morning sun. Bees are early risers, and
should have every inducement given them for the maintenance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">- 115 -</span>
of so excellent a practice. A few years since, many strong opinions
were expressed in favour of a northern aspect for hives. The chief
reason given for those opinions, though very plausible, appears to
us to be a very partial and inadequate one. It was said that, when
the hives face the south, the bees may, like the incautious
swallow in the fable, be tempted to fly abroad in the transient
winter sunshine, and then perish in the freezing atmosphere when a
passing cloud intervenes. But it is a very easy matter, if considered
needful, to screen the entrance by fixing up matting so as to intercept
the rays of the sun. At our own apiary we make no alteration
in winter, under the belief that the bees will take care of themselves,
and they seldom venture out when the weather is unsuitable.</p>

<p>With hives exposed in the open garden, it is a good practice to
wind hay-bands round them in frosty weather, as such a protection
enables the bees to resist the cold.</p>

<p>When a thaw occurs, everything, both in and out of doors, has
a great deal of dampness about it. The combs of a hive are not
exempt from this, so that it is advisable to have slight upward
ventilation in winter. Holes the size of a pin's head allow of the
escape of a good deal of bad air, which is generated by the
exhalations of the bees, as well as by the dampness before referred
to. These holes being small, do not create sufficient draft through
the hives to be pernicious; if closed up by propolis, are readily
reopened with a pin. With wooden hives in winter, a bell glass is
often found to be useful; it should be placed over the hole in the
crown-board, with a zinc trough to receive the condensed moisture.</p>

<p>In summer bees do much towards ventilating their own stock-hives.
The observant apiarian will not fail to remark how, on a
warm day, several of the little creatures will stand at the entrance
with their abdomens slightly raised, and their twinkling wings in
rapid motion, producing a current of air inwards; while another
set are engaged in like manner, driving the bad air out, so that a
supply of pure oxygen is conveyed to the crowded inmates. In
this fanning operation their wings vibrate with such rapidity, that
their shape is as indistinct as are the spokes of a wheel when
revolving in rapid centrifugal motion.</p>

<p>This important office entails great physical exertion on the
part of the bees, and they relieve each other in detachments.</p>

<p>Some bee-keepers find an adapting board convenient for placing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">- 116 -</span>
underneath straw supers, as it facilitates their removal. These
boards are made of mahogany half an inch thick, with a hole in the
centre corresponding with that in the stock hive. We do not
consider it necessary to fix cross sticks in the straw stock hives,
as is frequently done; but if the apiarian prefers to have his
hives so furnished, there is no serious objection to it. These
observations refer to our Cottager's hive (<a href="#Page_34">page 34</a>).</p>

<p>There is another little matter of detail that should be named
here; that is, the necessity of the bee-keeper always having a
common hive in readiness near the bees, so as to be able to
secure any swarm which may unexpectedly start.</p>

<p>Here our pleasant task must close. We trust that all information
has been given that is needful to enable the practical bee-keeper
to begin business, and the scientific apiarian to commence
his observations. By way of illustrating the two characters combined,
we will conclude by quoting another simple idyl by the
German bee-keeper, Herr Braun, whose winter musings we have
already presented to the reader.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would remind all bee-keepers who earnestly
desire success, and who hope to draw pecuniary profit from their
pursuit, of the golden rule in bee-keeping:&mdash;"Keep your stocks
strong." In exercising the assiduous attention and persevering
effort, which that maxim enjoins, they will not only be regarded
as <i>bee-keepers</i>, but, as Mr. Langstroth says, will acquire a right to
the title of <i>bee-masters</i>.</p>

<p>The "Working Apiary" in the Great Exhibition of 1851, will long live in
remembrance of the many thousand visitors who witnessed with much interest
the matchless industry of its busy occupants.</p>

<p>We extract the following from many notices that appeared in the public
journals relative thereto.</p>

<p>In noticing the hives exhibited in the Crystal Palace, I would say, first and
foremost in my opinion stands <span class="smcap">Mr. Taylor's</span> Eight-bar Hive, and Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Neighbour and Son's</span> Improved Cottage Hive, both exhibited by Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Neighbour</span>.&mdash;<i>J. H. Payne, see Cottage Gardener, Nos. 169, 170.</i></p>

<p><i>From the "Illustrated London News."</i></p>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Apiary consists of a large glass case, with parts of
the sides covered with perforated zinc, for the sake of ventilation. This apiary
contains three hives; first <span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Ventilating Box-Hive, containing
from 15,000 to 20,000 bees, which were hived on the 30th of April of the
present year, the day before that of the opening of the Great Exhibition;
<span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Observatory Glass Hive, containing about the same number as
the box-hive; and a two storied square box-hive, with sloping roof. From
this latter, however, the bees decamped within a week after they had been
hived, owing to some disturbance, or perhaps, to the dislike taken by the bees
to their new habitation. The Ventilating Box-Hive is, in shape, square,
having windows and shutters. The entrance is at the back, enabling the bees
to go to Kensington Gardens, or other resorts, when they please. Above the
wooden box is placed a bell glass, into which the bees ascend to work
through circular opening in, the top of the square box. In the top of the
bell-glass is an aperture through which is inserted a tubular trunk of perforated
zinc, to take off the moisture from within. The Observatory Hive is of glass,
with a superior crystal compartment, an opening being formed between the
two; the bees are at present forming a comb in this upper glass, which affords
a very interesting sight, as generally speaking, the bees are in such a cluster
when at work that one can scarcely view their mathematically formed cells.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">- 120 -</span>
A straw cover is suspended over the upper compartment by a rope over a
pulley, which cover is raised up by the attendant at pleasure. The larger or
bottom compartment rests on a wooden floor, which has a circular groove sinking
therein to receive the bell glass. A landing-place projecting, as usual, with
sunken way, to enable the bees to pass in and out of their habitation, completes
this contrivance.</p>

<p>In addition to Mr. <span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Crystal Apiary, he also exhibits a
Cottager's Straw Hive, Taylor's Amateur Bee-Hive, a Glass Hive, <span class="smcap">Nutt's</span>
Patent Collateral Hive, the Ladies' Observatory Hive, <span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Improved
Cottage Hive, and <span class="smcap">Payne's</span> Cottage Hive.</p>

<p>The Cottager's Hive is simply that of the form we find in use in most
parts of the country, where the industrious cottagers or their wives, by a little
attention to their interesting little labourers, are enabled to add something to
their usually scanty earnings. This kind of hive is usually made of straw,
resting on a circular wooden board, with part of the board or floor projecting
in front as a lauding place for the bees, which enter under the edge of the
straw by means of a sinking in the floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taylor's</span> Amateur's Bee-Hive consists of three small square boxes, one
above another, with a roof over the top story; the ventilation being effected
by perforations under the eaves; each side of every story has a window and
shutter. The landing place is in front of the bottom story, and the entrance
to the hive is a long slit about &frac34; inch high.</p>

<p>The Glass Hive or Ladies' Observatory Hive, is similar to that in which
the bees are at work in Mr. <span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Apiary already mentioned, but
on account of the number of bees at work therein, and the extent of comb
already effected, the interior perches cannot be seen. These wooden perches
are arranged in parallel lines, leaving a space next the glass all round, the
whole being framed together with a bar at right angles, and resting on an
upright support in the middle.</p>

<p>The Improved Cottage Hive of the same exhibitor consists of a straw
circular lower compartment, having windows and outside shutters. A thermometer
is placed just inside one of the windows. The floor is of wood, with
a landing place and sunken way, as already mentioned in some of the other
hives. In the top, which is also of wood, are three circular perforations, each
of about two inches in diameter; above which are placed as many bell-glasses.
There is a small hole in the top of each of the glasses, through which a perforated
tubular trunk is inserted, for the sake of taking off the moisture from
the interior of the hive. Within the glass is a feeding-trough of zinc, circular
in shape, with a floating perforated floor, on which the bees alight, and in the
111
winter season regale themselves with the honey which is found in the
various perforations, as it floats up to the level of the honey, contained in the
small filling-trough, through which the honey, or beer and sugar, is poured.
The glasses are covered with a straw cap, removable at pleasure.</p>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> contributions are completed with, tin perforated
fumigators, by the use of which the bees are stupefied for a while, when
required to be moved from one hive to another; and specimens of honey and
honey-comb of the season 1850.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">- 121 -</span></p>

<p><i>From the "Express."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bees and Bee-Hives.</span>&mdash;In the North-East Gallery directly under the
Transept are arranged by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span>, of Holborn, several descriptions
of bee-hives, which it will be interesting to many of our readers to
examine, as this branch of rural economy is claiming much general and
deserved attention throughout the country. The novelty of these hives consists
in the facilities that are afforded in taking therefrom at any time of the
gathering season the purest honey without destroying or even injuring the
bees, thus humanely superseding the barbarous and hateful system of murdering
these interesting insects, to obtain the produce of their industry.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining the group of untenanted bee-hives may be observed
living hives with the bees most industriously at work. These useful little
creatures have been highly honoured by the Executive Committee, for of all
the animal workers that contribute to the interest of the Exhibition they
alone are allowed therein to display their matchless ingenuity and skill. By
a simple contrivance the bees are allowed egress and ingress without in the
least degree molesting the visitors, thus enabling the admirers of the works
of nature to view the whole process of forming the cells and depositing the
honey therein.</p>

<p>Within these few days Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span> have added to the Apiary, a
bee-hive constructed entirely of glass, protected by a cover neatly made of
straw, but so contrived, that on application to the attendant can be removed
instantly, thus illustrating more particularly the curious workmanship of these
amusing insects.</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen, and the Prince Consort, with the Royal Children,
were some time engaged in watching with deep interest the busy scene before
them, and putting many questions relating to the habits and economy of the
honey bee.</p>


<p id="International" class="caption3">INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION 1861.</p>

<p><i>From the "Illustrated London News," August 16, 1862.</i></p>

<p>One of the most interesting and instructive objects in the Exhibition, is a
transparent hive, in which the bees may be seen at full work. Among the
collection of bee-hives exhibited by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour and Son</span>, is one
of glass, stocked with a colony of Italian Alp bees. Here the queen bee
may be seen surrounded by her subjects, which pay the most deferential
attention to their sovereign. Through an aperture cut in the wall, the busy
throng of bees are continually passing and repassing. They go out at their
pleasure into the open court, fly over the annexe into the grounds of the
Horticultural Society and other adjacent gardens, and return laden with
sweets.</p>

<p><i>From the "Journal of Horticulture" October 21, 1862.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour, G. &amp; Sons</span>, 149, Regent Street, and 127, Holborn, No. 2157,
have a very handsome and complete stall, on ascending the steps of which we
found a flourishing stock of Ligurians, apparently not at all ashamed of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">- 122 -</span>
public position which they occupied, and working vigorously in the full light
of day. The queen, one of the largest and finest-coloured we have met with,
was perambulating the combs and receiving the homage of her subjects, stopping
frequently to deposit an egg in every empty cell. The hive itself was a
"Woodbury Unicomb," handsomely got up in mahogany, invented as its
name implies, by our valued correspondent. "<span class="smcap">A Devonshire Bee-keeper</span>,"
the construction of which will be most readily understood by an inspection of
the engraving at <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>. Its distinctive features are, the adaptation of the
moveable-bar system to unicomb-hives, by which any colony in an apiary of
"Woodbury-hives" can be placed in the unicomb-hive in a few minutes, and the
use of "outside Venetians," or "sun blinds." as they are called, instead of
the usual impervious shutters. By this contrivance light is never excluded, so
that when the hive is open for inspection, all its inmates continue their avocation
with their accustomed regularity, and a quiet and orderly scene is presented
to the spectator, instead of the hubbub and confusion which ensues in
ordinary unicomb-hives. On the left-hand side of the unicomb hangs a
beautifully executed drawing of a Ligurian queen bee magnified, together with
the queen worker and drone of <i>Apis Ligustica</i>, of the natural size. Immediately
under the drawing is placed a square glass super containing nearly 40 lbs.
of the finest honey-comb. On the right of the unicomb-hive is another super of
the same description, containing nearly 30 lbs. of the purest honey. These
supers are, undoubtedly, by far the finest in the Exhibition, and are the first
worked in England by Ligurian bees, being from the apiary of "<span class="smcap">A Devonshire
Bee-keeper</span>." In addition to these the most striking objects, are shown
Neighbour's Improved Single Box and Cottage Hives, Taylor's Bar-Hives,
Woodbury Frame and Bar-hives, the new Bottle-feeder, and bee apparatus of
every description. It will be apparent from the foregoing, that Messrs. Neighbour's
stall is well worth inspection, although the various novelties it contains
appear to have met with but scant appreciation by the Jury, who merely awarded
to them that "honourable mention" so lavishly accorded to the far less
deserving objects.</p>

<p><i>From the "Illustrated News of the World" September 6, 1862.</i></p>

<p>One of the most interesting and instructive objects is the honey bee at
full work in transparent hives. In the International Exhibition, Class 9,
Eastern Annexe, Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span> and Son, of Holborn and Regent-street,
exhibit, amongst a collection of the most approved bee-hives and apparatus, a
glass hive, stocked with a colony of Italian Alp bees; the hive is so constructed
as to admit of easily seeing the queen, surrounded by the working bees.
Contrary to the long established notion that the bees work only in the dark
this hive is completely open to broad daylight. The bees do not manifest the
least dislike to the exposure, and they are not discomfited when light is
occasionally admitted for inspecting them. It is obvious that a knowledge of
this new feature must tend to a more general acquaintance with the habits and
hidden mysteries of the bee than has hitherto been the case. The queen may
be seen depositing the eggs in the cells; in this manner she goes on multiplying
the species, the working bees surrounding her, and paying the most deferential
attention, with their heads always towards her. Not the least interesting part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">- 123 -</span>
is to watch the entrance; facility is afforded for doing so, the sunken way
communicating with the hive being covered with a flat piece of glass; the
busy throng, pass and repass through the aperture cut in the wall, so that
the bees go out at their pleasure into the open court, fly over the Annexe into
the Horticultural and other adjacent gardens, and return laden with crystal
sweets gathered from the flowers. The novelty of being able to inspect living
bees, and those of a new variety, as easily as goods in a shop window, will well
repay the trouble of finding Messrs. Neighbour's stand. These gentlemen will
no doubt cheerfully give any information that may be required.</p>

<p><i>From the "Gardener's Weekly Magazine" September 1, 1862. Conducted by
Shirley Hibberd, Esq., F.R.H.S.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour and Son</span>, 149, Regent Street, London, (2157).&mdash;This is the
most important of the exhibitions in this department. The "Bees at work"
are in hives open to the inspection of visitors, the bees passing out through
tubes to the open air, and not being visible within the building except through
the glass of the hives. The collection of hives of all kinds is complete and interesting,
and we subjoin a figure of the stand (see <a href="#Page_100">page 100</a>) to show how bees as
well as hives may be exhibited conveniently. Amongst the various contrivances
exhibited by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span>, Nutt's Collateral Hive has an
important place, and though very fancifully got up, and therefore very
attractive to amateur bee-keepers, we must make the same objection to it
as we have above to other forms of the same from different makers. The
Single-box Hive, the Taylor's Shallow Eight-bar Hive, are the best bee-boxes
in this collection, and every way admirable. Here are no fancy ventilators
which the bees will close up, nor provoking side boxes which they will
hesitate to enter, and from which it will be hard to dislodge them in order
to get them to winter in the "pavilion." Whoever begins bee-keeping with
either of these will have a fair chance of success. The most popular of the
hives is that called the "Improved Cottage." Its popularity no doubt is due
to the compromise between wood and straw which it accomplishes. People
cannot get rid of the idea that a bee-hive <i>must</i> be made of straw, though it is
a material so ill adapted for union of swarms, supering and other operations of
advanced bee culture. The "Cottager's Hive" is well adapted for "those
apiarians who are desirous of setting their poorer neighbours in the way of
keeping bees on the improved system." It consists of stock hive, small
super-hive, and straw cover, and is on the principle of Payne's, which has
been most successful among country people who have got so far as to prefer
keeping, to killing their bees. The "Woodbury Bar and Frame Hive" is
a novel construction, combining all the best features of the best bar boxes,
and adding some new ones of great value and importance. We recommend
every bee-keeper to become possessed of this admirable contrivance, with
which Mr. Woodbury has accomplished wonderful things in the multiplication
of the new race of Ligurian bees. In general form and proportions it
resembles Taylor's and Tegetmeier's boxes, but in the arrangement of the
bars it is unique. The stock box is furnished with ten moveable bars and
frames, after the German plan. Each bar has a projection running along
the under side; this ridge is chosen by the bees for the foundation of combs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">- 124 -</span>
rendering guide combs unnecessary. The supers have glass sides and eight
bars, so that the operator need never be in doubt when to add another box
above or take away the harvest.</p>

<p>The "Unicomb," or one-comb observatory-hive, is intended solely for
purposes of observation, and though furnished with doors, to keep up a
uniform degree of heat, Messrs. Neighbour have found in their experience
at the Regent's Park Gardens and elsewhere, that the bees manifest no
dislike to a continual exposure to light. As this elegant contrivance can be
placed in the window of a drawing-room, it is adapted to the amusement and
instruction of the family circle, as well as to the more serious objects of the
etomologist and scientific apiarian. All that is necessary is to connect the
outlet with the open air by means of a length of tubing or wooden tunnel,
and the bees pass in and out without obtaining access to the room, and all
the mysteries of the hive are open to daily observation. There are numerous
other hives, bee-feeders, bee armour, &amp;c., &amp;c., which we have not space to
notice, but which we advise our apiarian friends to inspect, as the collection
of Messrs. Neighbour illustrates fully every department of this interesting
subject.</p>


<p id="Bath_and_West" class="caption3">BATH AND WEST OF ENGLAND AGRICULTURAL SHOW AT EXETER, IN JUNE, 1863.</p>

<p><i>From the "Journal of Horticulture," June 23, 1863.</i></p>

<p>A novel feature in the Exhibition of the Bath and West of England
Agricultural Society which took place at Exeter last week, was the stall of
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour &amp; Sons</span>, in which were exhibited bees at work in glass
hives, and apiarian appliances of every description. There were two Ligurian
stocks of bees at full work, one in a full sized Woodbury Unicomb Hive,
having been brought from London for the occasion, and the other in a smaller
hive of the same description being from the neighbouring apiary of our valued
correspondent, "<span class="smcap">A Devonshire Bee-Keeper</span>." Amongst the hives exhibited,
the Woodbury Frame Hive in straw appeared both novel and good, whilst
amongst the apparatus, artificial combs and the stereotyped plates for making
them, seemed to us the most worthy of attention.</p>

<p>There was a remarkably curious specimen of artificial combs or partition
wall partially fabricated into complete comb by the bees, which struck us as being
well worth examination, showing, as it did, the various stages by which this
transformation is effected, and being calculated to throw light on the problem
as to the mode in which bees construct their combs. It is almost unnecessary
to state, that this unique and instructive stall was crowded throughout the
week, and we hope its financial results were such as will lead Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Neighbour</span> to continue their attendance at the Society's meetings.</p>

<p><i>From the "Western Times" Exeter, June 12, 1863.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">For the Little Busy Bee.</span>&mdash;Next to the poultry tents, and set back
against the yard fencing, is the exhibition of Mr. <span class="smcap">George Neighbour &amp; Sons</span>,
127, High Holborn, and 149, Regent Street, London, inventors and manufacturers
of improved bee-hives for taking honey without the destruction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">- 125 -</span>
the bees. The savage knows where to find the nest of the wild bee, and how
to get at his honey; but all the improvement upon the covetousness of the
savage made by the long after ages of the world to modern times, was to find
means of luring the pattern of industry to a convenient atelier where he might
be more easily, first murdered and then robbed. Their habits early attracted
the attention of some of the best observers of ancient as well as modern times;
Cicero and Pliny tell of the philosopher Hyliscus quitting human society and
retiring to the desert to contemplate their peaceful industry. The ancient
poet in his <i>Sic vos non vobis</i> plaintively sings over bee and beast, living, or
rather dying, not for themselves, but the lord of creation, yet was it left to
modern times&mdash;very modern times&mdash;to join the sentiment of humanity to the
rapacity of the barbarian. Mr. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span> has a very complete collection of
specimens of the ingenious and successful contrivances in the construction of
hives for the double object of preserving the honey and the life of the bee; and
also, subsidiarily of promoting its comfort during its busy and useful life.
We are not allowed to forget here, that we have residing in our city one of the
first apiarians in the kingdom&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Woodbury</span>, of Mount Radford.
If the bee philosophy be his hobby, we may recollect that all great discoveries
and improvements owe their existence to men who have had the power and the
will to concentrate their faculties upon a single object. One proof of his
genius in this his favourite department of action, is seen among this collection
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> in the "Woodbury Unicomb Hive." It might be when
closed up, for ought that appears, a neat case of books; but on opening two
doors of the Venetian blind pattern, back and front, we see between the glass
walls, the insect city exposed to view with all the population in action. There
it may be seen</p>

<p>Some of the hives are constructed chiefly for the purpose of promoting a
philosophic observation of the bee's habits and methods of procedure in his
wonderful work. "<span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Unicomb Observatory Hive" is a great
novelty, being constructed with glass sides, the hidden mysteries of the hive
being exposed to the full light of day. "<span class="smcap">Huber's</span> Book or Leaf Hive" is
constructed to facilitate the object of the scientific apiarian. But the class of
hives which will most interest those desirous of promoting bee-keeping among
the many will be those for the cottage. There can be no doubt that many a
poor cottager in the country, if he could be made to see the advantage it
would be to him, and were taught the most economical and successful way of
managing this species of "live stock," would add thereby something considerable
to his small earnings in the course of a summer. Members of Cottage
Garden Societies have turned their attention to it very generally; but to get
the thing well afloat, requires in every district the devotion of some earnest
enthusiast who will take up the apostolic rule of action "This one thing I do."
There is the No. 5, "Improved Cottage Hive," in which three bell glasses are
employed, enabling you to take a glass of the purest honey from the hive in
the most vigorous period of the season. Then there are other hives of simpler
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">- 126 -</span>
construction and less expensive, but all illustrative of the sentiment of humanity
which seeks to preserve from wanton destruction those useful and interesting
auxiliaries to our luxury and comfort. This comparatively unimportant stand,
in point of size, cannot but attract the attention of a large number of visitors,
especially of the ladies and the clergy, who are desirous of promoting the
cultivation of the bee among the poor. To heighten the interest for the
curious, in one of Mr. <span class="smcap">Woodbury's</span> hives the bees are all alive and at it, and
for those who are disposed to go further into the subject, information is
available touching this fashionable, profitable, and domesticated member of the
Apiarian family, the Ligurian and Italian Alp-bee. Our old dark-coated delver
is threatened with supercession, just as the black rat was driven off by the
Norwegian invader, now in possession, and as the old races of cattle are being
metamorphosed into the sleek, shapely, beef-bearing, small-boned animals of
the present time.</p>

<p><i>From the "Devon Weekly Times" June 8, 1863.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bees.</span>&mdash;Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour &amp; Sons</span>, of London, are exhibitors of two
<span class="smcap">Woodbury</span> Unicomb Hives, showing the royal and common bees in full work.
These hives are very ingeniously constructed, and were invented by Mr. <span class="smcap">T.
Woodbury</span>, of Mount Radford. Among other apiarian attractions, we may
mention the improved Cottage and Cottager's Hives, which are well worthy
the notice of those for whom they are designed, and the Ladies' Observatory
Hive. The Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span> also exhibit Ligurian bees.</p>

<p><i>From "Woolmer's Exeter Gazette" June 12, 1863.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Improved Bee-Hives.</span>&mdash;At a stand near the poultry tents, are exhibited
<span class="smcap">Neighbour's</span> Improved Bee-hives for the taking of honey without the destruction
of bees. The hives are stocked with the famous Ligurian bee. The Unicomb
Observatory Hive is constructed with glass sides, so that the whole of the
movements of the Apiarian colony are visible, including the proceedings of the
queen and her court. This and some of the other descriptions of hives manufactured
by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span> are invented by <span class="smcap">T. W. Woodbury</span>, Esq. They
are furnished with moveable bars, after the German fashion. Each bar has a
projection along the underside; this ridge being waxed, induces the bees to
build parallel combs&mdash;thus obviating the necessity for a guide comb. This
description of hive is best suited for the Ligurian or Italian Alp-bee. Stocks
of this species, now so much in repute, may be obtained of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span>

<p id="Royal_Agr" class="caption3">ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SHOW, NEWCASTLE, 1864.</p>

<p><i>From the "Northern Daily Express" July 22,&mdash;(Published at Newcastle.)</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Model Factory.</span>&mdash;Stand 191&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Neighbour &amp; Sons.</span> Regent Street,
and High Holborn, London. We have heard of model farms and model
lodging houses for the working classes, but it was reserved for the Royal
Agricultural Society's Meeting in 1864 to introduce to our notice a model
factory, where we may see representatives of the working classes busily engaged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">- 127 -</span>
in their daily avocations. The stand which we have quoted above, may afford
fruitful study to such philanthropists as the Earl of Shaftesbury, who make
it their benevolent aim to elevate the masses, and the lesson here given from
actual life will not be lost upon working men themselves. There are several
striking features worthy of notice in the "model factory." We can clearly
perceive that it has been established on a principle which is essential to the
success of any great concern&mdash;namely: the principle of a good understanding
amongst the operatives themselves, and between them and the head of the
establishment. What strikes us in this model factory is the unity of action
which reigns throughout. There is no jostling of rival interests, and no
misunderstandings, or cross purposes. The operatives in this establishment are
so numerous that we question if any one has as yet been able to count their
number, and yet all seem to be working in perfect harmony, their joint
labour continually leading to one beautiful and sublime result. Another
feature specially noticeable in the establishment, in question is the principle
of subordination. Singular to say, that while the operatives are males<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
the foreman of this model factory is a female; but that circumstance
need not shock the sensibilities of our fair friends any more than it ought to
offend the prejudices of the sterner sex, inasmuch as the mighty empire of
Great Britain is ruled by the gentle hand of a female; and moreover, in the
one case as in the other, the presiding genius, amids all her official cares and
duties, takes care to preserve the modesty of her sex. She never in the
slightest degree obtrudes herself needlessly on public observation, and probably
on that very account the respect shown to her by her subjects is the more
profound and devoted. There is, however, one particular in which we would
take leave to demur to the idea of this factory being in every respect regarded
as a "model." We have not been able to discover that there is any particular
period of the day in which the operatives are allowed to take refreshments.
We, in England, have been accustomed to regard the dinner hour somewhat
in the light of a sacred institution. And if the council of the Royal Agricultural
Society mean to set this up as a model institution, we are of opinion
that some explanation on this point is desirable. Indeed we have not been
able to discover that the operatives in this establishment take any refreshment
whatever. If they do, it must be "on the sly," vulgarly speaking. There
is one peculiarity, however, which must tend to popularize this institution,
and which has served to make it one of the most attractive objects on the
show ground. It is the fashion in all the great factories which abound on
the banks of the Tyne and throughout the country generally to act on the
principle of exclusiveness to a very great extent, and perhaps wisely so. As
you approach the door you see an intimation in legible characters, "No
admission except on business." This may be very proper, but it is rather
tantalising. In the model factory which we are now describing all the operations
are open to inspection. Every action is patent to the eye of the
spectator. This has been effected by a skilful contrivance, and it is this
contrivance in fact, which has entitled the inventor to obtain a place in the
show ground for his model factory, which he describes by the somewhat ambiguous
term of "a new implement." But our readers may wish to learn what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">- 128 -</span>
is the staple manufacture of this wonderful workshop. We reply&mdash;"honey."
The factory we speak of is nothing more nor less than a bee-hive; or, to quote
from the catalogue, "An Unicomb Observatory Bee-hive," with living Italian
Alpine bees at full work; it was invented by <span class="smcap">T. W. Woodbury</span>, of Exeter;
and is improved and manufactured by the exhibitors. As implied by its
name this hive has one comb, so that both sides are fully exposed to the light
of day, thus allowing of an easy inspection of the queen-bee, surrounded
by her retinue.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
